<p class="dropcap">ime was when half a hundred ports ringing
round the semi-island of Scotland invited
your boat to make harbour; you
could "return" at almost any point of entry
you chose, or chance chose for you.</p>

<p>To-day, if you have been gone for two hundred
and fifty years, or if you never were "of Scotia
dear," except as a mere reading person with an
inclination toward romance, you can make harbour
after a transatlantic voyage at but one sea-city,
and that many miles up a broad in-reach<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>ing
river. Or, you can come up the English
roads by Carlisle or by Newcastle, and cross
the Border in the conquering way, which never
yet was all-conquering. There is shipping, of
course, out of the half hundred old harbours.
But it is largely the shipping that goes and
comes, fishing boats and coast pliers and the
pleasure boats of the western isles.</p>

<p>You cannot come back from the far corners
of the earth&mdash;to which Scotland has sent such
majorities of her sons, since the old days when
she squandered them in battle on the Border or
on the Continent, to the new days when she
squanders them in colonization so that half a
dozen of her counties show decline in population&mdash;but
you must come to Glasgow. The
steamers are second-class compared with those
which make port farther south. They are
slower. But their very lack of modern splendour
and their slow speed give time in which to
reconstruct your Scotland, out of which perhaps
you have been banished since the Covenant, or
the Fifteen, or the Forty Five; or perhaps out
of which you have never taken the strain which
makes you romantic and Cavalier, or Presbyterian
and canny. We who have it think that
you who have it not lose something very precious
for which there is no substitute. We pity you.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
More clannish than most national tribesmen, we
cannot understand how you can endure existence
without a drop of Scotch.</p>

<p>Always when I go to Scotland I feel myself
returning "home." Notwithstanding that it is
two centuries and a bittock since my clerical ancestor
left his home, driven out no doubt by
the fluctuant fortunes of Covenanter and Cavalier,
or, it may be, because he believed he carried
the only true faith in his chalice&mdash;only he
did not carry a chalice&mdash;and, either he would
keep it undefiled in the New World, or he would
share it with the benighted in the New World;
I know not.</p>

<p>All that I know is that in spite of the fact that
the Scotch in me has not been replenished since
those two centuries and odd, I still feel that it
is a search after ancestors when I go back to
Scotland. And, if a decree of banishment was
passed by the unspeakable Hanoverians after
the first Rising, and lands and treasure were forfeited,
still I look on entire Scotland as my
demesne. I surrender not one least portion of
it. Not any castle, ruined or restored, is alien
to me. Highlander and Lowlander are my undivisive
kin. However empty may seem the
moorlands and the woodlands except of grouse
and deer, there is not a square foot of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
twenty-nine thousand seven hundred eighty-five
square miles but is filled for me with a
longer procession, if not all of them royal, than
moved ghostly across the vision of Macbeth.</p>

<p>Nothing happens any longer in Scotland.
Everything has happened. Quite true, Scotland
may some time reassert itself, demand its
independence, cease from its romantic reliance
on the fact that it did furnish to England, to the
British Empire, the royal line, the Stewarts.
Even Queen Victoria, who was so little a Stewart,
much more a Hanoverian and a Puritan,
was most proud of her Stewart blood, and regarded
her summers in the Highlands as the
most ancestral thing in her experience.</p>

<p>Scotland may at sometime dissolve the Union,
which has been a union of equality, accept the
lower estate of a province, an American
"state," among the possible four of "Great
Britain and Ireland," and enter on a more vigorous
provincial life, live her own life, instead
of exporting vigour to the colonies&mdash;and her exportation
is almost done. She may fill this
great silence which lies over the land, and is
fairly audible in the deserted Highlands, with
something of the human note instead of the call
of the plover.</p>

<p>But, for us, for the traveler of to-day, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
at least for another generation, Scotland is a
land where nothing happens, where everything
has happened. It has happened abundantly,
multitudinously, splendidly. No one can regret&mdash;except
he is a reformer and a socialist&mdash;the
absence of the doings of to-day; they would
be so realistic, so actual, so small, so of the
province and the parish. Whereas in the
Golden Age, which is the true age of Scotland,
men did everything&mdash;loving and fighting, murdering
and marauding, with a splendour which
makes it seem fairly not of our kind, of another
time and of another world.</p>

<p>You must know your Scottish history, you
must be filled with Scottish romance, above all,
you must know your poetry and ballads, if you
would rebuild and refill the country as you go.
Not only over fair Melrose lies the moonlight
of romance, making the ruin more lovely and
more complete than the abbey could ever have
been in its most established days, but over the
entire land there lies the silver pall of moonlight,
making, I doubt not, all things lovelier
than in reality.</p>

<p>We truly felt that we should have arranged
for "a hundred pipers an' a' an' a'." But we
left King's Cross station in something of disguise.
The cockneys did not know that we were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
returning to Scotland. Our landing was to be
made as quietly, without pibroch, as when the
Old Pretender landed at Peterhead on the far
northeastern corner, or when the Young Pretender
landed at Moidart on the far western
rim of the islands. And neither they nor we
pretenders.</p>

<span class="caption">JAMES VI.</span>
</div>

<p>The East Coast route is a pleasant way, and
I am certain the hundred pipers, or whoever
were the merry musicmakers who led the English
troops up that way when Edward First was
king, and all the Edwards who followed him,
and the Richards and the Henrys&mdash;they all
measured ambition with Scotland and failed&mdash;I
am certain they made vastly more noise than
this excellently managed railway which moves
across the English landscape with due English
decorum.</p>

<p>We were to stop at Peterborough, and walk
out to where, "on that ensanguined block at
Fotheringay," the queenliest queen of them all
laid her head and died that her son, James
Sixth of Scotland, might become First of England.
We stopped at York for the minster,
and because Alexander III was here married to
Margaret, daughter of Henry III; and their
daughter being married to Eric of Norway in
those old days when Scotland and Norway were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
kin, became mother to the Maid of Norway, one
of the most pathetic and outstanding figures in
Scottish history, simply because she died&mdash;and
from her death came divisions to the kingdom.</p>

<p>We paused at Durham, where in that gorgeous
tomb St. Cuthbert lies buried after a brave and
Scottish life. We only looked across the purpling
sea where already the day was fading,
where the slant rays of the sun shone on Lindisfarne,
which the spirit of St. Cuthbert must
prefer to Durham.</p>

<p>All unconsciously an old song came to sing
itself as I looked across that wide water&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"My love's in Germanie,<br />
Send him hame, send him hame,<br />
My love's in Germanie,<br />
Fighting for royalty,<br />
He's as brave as brave can be,<br />
Send him hame, send him hame!"<br />
</p>

<p>Full many a lass has looked across this sea
and sung this lay&mdash;and shall again.</p>

<p>The way is filled with ghosts, long, long processions,
moving up and down the land. A
boundary is always a lodestone, a lodeline.
Why do men establish it except that other men
dispute it? In the old days England called it
treason for a Borderer, man or woman, to intermarry
with Scotch Borderer. The lure, you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
see, went far. Even so that kings and ladies,
David and Matilda, in the opposing edges of the
Border, married each other. And always there
was Gretna Green.</p>

<p>Agricola came this way, and the Emperor
Severus. There is that interesting, far-journeying
&AElig;neas Sylvius Piccolomini, the "Gil
Blas of the Middle Ages," who later became
Pius II. He came to this country by boat, but
becoming afraid of the sea, returned by land,
even opposite to the way we are going. Froissart
came, but reports little. Perhaps Chaucer,
but not certainly. George Fox came and called
the Scots "a dark carnal people."</p>

<p>With the Act of Union the stream grows
steady and full. There is Ben Jonson, trudging
along the green roadway out yonder; for
on foot, and all the way from London, he came
northward to visit William Drummond of Hawthornden.
Who would not journey to such a
name? But, alas, a fire destroyed "my journey
into Scotland sung with all the adventures."
All that I know of Ben is that he was impressed
with Lomond&mdash;two hundred years before Scott.</p>

<p>And there trails Taylor, "water poet," hoping
to rival Rare Ben, on his "Pennyless Pilgrimage,"
when he actually went into Scotland
without a penny, and succeeded in getting gold<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
to further him on his way&mdash;"Marr, Murraye,
Elgin, Bughan, and the Lord of Erskine, all of
these I thank them, gave me gold to defray my
charges in my journey."</p>

<p>James Howell, carries a thin portfolio as he
travels the highway. But we must remember
that he wrote his "Perfect Description of the
People and Country of Scotland" in the Fleet.</p>

<p>Here is Doctor Johnson, in a post chaise.
Of course, Sir! "Mr. Boswell, an active lively
fellow is to conduct me round the country."
And he's still a lively conductor. Surely you
can see the Doctor, in his high boots, and his
very wide brown cloth great coat with pockets
which might be carrying two volumes of his
folio dictionary, and in his hand a large oak
staff. One tries to forget that years before
this journey he had said to Boswell, "Sir, the
noblest prospect that a Scotchman ever sees
is the highroad that leads him to London."
And, was there any malice in Boswell's final
record&mdash;"My illustrious friend, being now desirous
to be again in the great theater of life
and animated existence"?</p>

<p>The poet Gray preceded him a little, and even
John Wesley moves along the highroad seeking
to save Scottish souls as well as English. A
few years afterward James Hogg comes down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
this way to visit his countryman, Tammas Carlyle
in London; who saw Hogg as "a little red-skinned
stiff rock of a body with quite the common
air of an Ettrick shepherd."</p>

<p>There is Scott, many times, from the age of
five when he went to Bath, till that last journey
back from Italy&mdash;to Dryburgh! And Shadowy
Jeanie Deans comes downward, walking her
"twenty-five miles and a bittock a day," to save
her sister from death.</p>

<p>Disraeli comes up this way when he was
young and the world was his oyster. Stevenson
passes up and down, sending his merry men
up and down. And one of the most native is
William Winter&mdash;"With a quick sense of freedom
and of home, I dashed across the Border
and was in Scotland."</p>

<p>There is a barricade of the Cheviots stretching
across between the two countries, but the
Romans built a Wall to make the division more
apparent. In the dawn of the centuries the
Romans came hither, and attempting to come
to Ultima Thule, Picts and Scots&mdash;whatever
they were, at least they were brave&mdash;met the
Romans on the Border, as yet unreported in the
world's history and undefined in the world's
geography, and sent them back into what is
England. The Romans in single journeys, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
in certain imperial attempts, did penetrate as
far as Inverness. But they never conquered
Scotland. Only Scotland of all the world held
them back. And in order to define their defeat
and to place limits to the unlimited Roman Empire,
the Great Wall was built, built by Hadrian,
that men might know where civilization, that
splendid thing called Roman civilization, and
barbarism did meet. Scotland was barbarism.
And I think, not in apology but in all pride, she
has remained something of this ever since.
Never conquered, never subdued.</p>

<p>The Wall was, in truth, a very palpable thing,
stretching from the Solway to the North Sea
at the Tyne, with ample width for the constant
patrol, with lookout towers at regular and frequent
intervals, with soldiers gathered from
every corner of the Empire, often the spawn
of it, and with much traffic and with even permanent
villas built the secure side of the barrier.
If you meet Puck on Pook's hill, he will tell you
all about it.</p>

<p>Our fast express moves swiftly northward,
through the littoral of Northumberland, as the
ship bearing Sister Clare moved through the
sea&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"And now the vessel skirts the strand<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>Of mountainous Northumberland;<br />
Towns, towers, and hills successive rise,<br />
And catch the nun's delighted eyes."<br />
</p>


<h4><i>Berwick</i></h4>

<p>The voyager enters Berwick with a curious
feeling. It is because of the voyagers who have
preceded him that this town is singular among
all the towns of the Empire. It is of the Empire,
it is of Britain; but battled round about,
and battled for as it has been since ambitious
time began, it is of neither England nor Scotland.
"Our town of Berwick-upon-Tweed," as
the phrase still runs in the acts of Parliament,
and in the royal proclamations; not England's,
not Scotland's. Our town, the King's
town.</p>

<p>For it is an independent borough (1551) since
the men who fared before us could not determine
which should possess it, and so our very own
time records that history in an actual fact. I
do not suppose the present serious-looking,
trades-minded people of the city, with their dash
of fair Danish, remember their singular situation
day by day. The tumult and the shouting
have died which made "the Border" the most
embattled place in the empire, and Berwick<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>-upon-Tweed
the shuttlecock in this international
game of badminton.</p>

<p>It is a dual town at the best. But what has it
not witnessed, what refuge, what pawn, has it
not been, this capital of the Debatable Land,
this Key of the Border.</p>

<p>The Tweed is here spanned by the Royal
Border Bridge, opened in 1850, and called "the
last Act of Union." But there is another
bridge, a Roman bridge of many spans, antique
looking as the Roman-Moorish-Spanish bridge
at Cordova, and as antique as 1609, an Act of
Union following swiftly on the footsteps of
King James VI&mdash;who joyously paused here to
fire a salute to himself, on his way to the imperial
throne.</p>

<p>The walls of Berwick, dismantled in 1820 and
become a promenade for peaceful townsfolk and
curious sightseers, date no farther back than
Elizabeth's time. But she had sore need of
them; for this "our town," was the refuge for
her harriers on retaliatory Border raids, particularly
that most terrible Monday-to-Saturday
foray of 1570, that answer to an attempt to
reassert the rights of Mary, when fifty castles
and peels and three hundred villages were laid
waste in order that Scotland might know that
Elizabeth was king.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>It was her kingly father, the Eighth Henry,
who ordered Hertford into Scotland&mdash;"There
to put all to fire and sword, to burn Edinburgh
town, and to raze and deface it, when you have
sacked it and gotten what you can of it, as there
may remain forever a perpetual memory of the
vengeance of God lighted upon it for their falsehood
and disloyalty. Sack Holyrood House and
as many towns and villages about Edinburgh
as ye conveniently can. Sack Leith and burn
it and subvert it, and all the rest, putting man,
woman and child to fire and sword without exception,
when any resistance is made against
you. And this done, pass over to the Fife land,
and extend like extremities and destructions in
all towns and villages whereunto ye may reach
conveniently, not forgetting among the rest, so
to spoil and turn upside down the Cardinal's
town of St. Andrews, as the upper stone may be
the nether, and not one stick stand by another,
sparing no creature alive within the same, especially
such as either in friendship or blood be
allied to the Cardinal. The accomplishment of
all this shall be most acceptable to the Majesty
and Honour of the King."</p>

<p>Berwick has known gentler moments, even
marrying and giving in marriage. It was at
this Border town that David, son of the Bruce,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
and Joanna, sister of Edward III, were united
in marriage. Even then did the kingdoms seek
an Act of Union. And Prince David was four,
and Princess Joanna was six. There was much
feasting by day and much revelry by night,
among the nobles of the two realms, while, no
doubt, the babies nodded drowsily.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 456px;">
<img src="images/i034.jpg" width="456" height="600" alt="QUEEN MARY." title="" />
<span class="caption">QUEEN MARY.</span>
</div>

<p>At Berwick John Knox united himself in marriage
with Margaret Stewart, member of the
royal house of Stewart, cousin, if at some remove,
from that Stewart queen who belonged
to "the monstrous regiment of women," and to
whose charms even the Calvinist John was sensitive.
One remembers that at Berwick John
was fifty, and Margaret was sixteen.</p>

<p>There is not much in Berwick to hold the attention,
unless one would dine direct on salmon
trout just drawn frae the Tweed. There are
memories, and modern content with what is
modern.</p>

<p>Perhaps the saddest eyes that ever looked
on the old town were those of Queen Mary, as
she left Jedburgh, after her almost fatal illness,
and after her hurried ride to the Hermitage to
see Bothwell, and just before the fatal affair in
Kirk o' Field. Even then, and even with her
spirit still unbroken, she felt the coming of the
end. "I am tired of my life," she said more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
than once to Le Croc, French ambassador, on
this journey as she circled about the coast and
back to Edinburgh.</p>

<p>She rode toward Berwick with an escort of
a thousand men, and looked down on the town
from Halidon Hill, on the west, where two hundred
years before (1333) the Scots under the
regent Douglass had suffered defeat by the English.</p>

<p>It was an old town then, and belonged to
Elizabeth. But it looked much as it does to-day;
the gray walls, so recently built; the red
roofs, many of them sheltering Berwickians to-day;
the church spires, for men worshiped God
in those days in churches, and according to the
creeds that warred as bitterly as crowns; masts
in the offing, whence this last time one might
take ship to France, that pleasant smiling land
so different from this dour realm. At all these
Mary must have looked wistfully and weariedly,
as the royal salute was fired for this errant
queen. She looked also, over the Border, then
becoming a hard-and-fast boundary, and down
the long, long road to Fotheringay, and to peace
at last and honour, in the Abbey.</p>

<p>It is well to stand upon this hill, before you
go on to the West and the Border, or on to the
North and the gray metropolis, that you may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
appreciate both the tragedy and the triumph
that is Scotland's and was Mary's. The North
Sea is turning purple far out on the horizon,
and white sea birds are flying across beyond
sound. The long level light of the late afternoon
is coming up over England. In the backward
of the Border a plaintive curlew is crying
in the West, as he has cried since the days of
Mary, and &aelig;ons before.</p>


<h4><i>Flodden</i></h4>

<p>You may go westward from here, by train
and coach, and carriage and on foot, to visit this
country where every field has been a battlefield,
where ruined peel towers finally keep the peace,
where castles are in ruins, and a few stately
modern homes proclaim the permanence of Scottish
nobility; and where there is no bird and
no flower unsung by Scottish minstrelsy, or
by Scott. Scott is, of course, the poet and
prose laureate of the Border. "Marmion" is
the lay, almost the guide-book. It should
be carried with you, either in memory or in
pocket.</p>

<p>If the day is not too far spent, the afternoon
sun too low, you can make Norham Castle before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
twilight, even as Marmion made it when he
opened the first canon of Scott's poem&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"Day set on Norham's castle steep<br />
And Tweed's fair river, broad and deep,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And Cheviot's mountains lone;</span><br />
The battled towers, the donjon keep,<br />
The loophole grates, where captives weep,<br />
The flanking walls that round it sweep,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In yellow luster shone."</span><br />
</p>

<p>There is but a fragment of that castle remaining,
and this, familiar to those who study
Turner in the National Gallery. A little village
with one broad street and curiously receding
houses attempts to live in the shadow of this
memory. The very red-stone tower has stood
there at the top of the steep bank since the middle
Eleven Hundreds. Henry II held it as a
royal castle, while his craven son John&mdash;not so
craven in battle&mdash;regarded it as the first of his
fortresses. Edward I made it his headquarters
while he pretended to arbitrate the rival
claims of the Scottish succession, and to establish
himself as the Lord Superior. On the
green hill of Holywell nearby he received the
submission of Scotland in 1291&mdash;the submission
of Scotland!</p>

<p>Ford castle is a little higher up the river,
where lodged the dubious lady with whom the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
king had dalliance in those slack days preceding
Flodden&mdash;the lady who had sung to him in
Holyrood the challenging ballad of "Young
Lochinvar!" James was ever a Stewart, and
regardful of the ladies.</p>

<p class="poem">
"What checks the fiery soul of James,<br />
Why sits the champion of dames<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Inactive on his steed?"</span><br />
</p>

<p>The Norman tower of Ford (the castle has
been restored), called the King's tower, looks
down on the battlefield, and in the upper room,
called the King's room, there is a carved fireplace
carrying the historic footnote&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"King James ye 4th of Scotland did lye<br />
here at Ford castle, A. D. 1513."<br />
</p>

<p>Somehow one hopes that the lady was not
sparring for time and Surrey, and sending messages
to the advancing Earl, but truly loved
this Fourth of the Jameses, grandfather to his
inheriting granddaughter.</p>

<p>Coldstream is the station for Flodden. But
the village, lying a mile away on the Scotch side
of the Tweed, has memories of its own. It was
here that the most famous ford was found between
the two countries, witness and way to so
many acts of disunion; from the time when
Edward I, in 1296, led his forces through it into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
Scotland, to the time when Montrose, in 1640,
led his forces through it into England.</p>

<p class="poem">
"There on this dangerous ford and deep<br />
Where to the Tweed Leet's eddies creep<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">He ventured desperately."</span><br />
</p>

<p>The river was spanned by a five-arch bridge
in 1763, and it was over this bridge that Robert
Burns crossed into England. He entered the
day in his diary, May 7, 1787. "Coldstream&mdash;went
over to England&mdash;Cornhill&mdash;glorious river
Tweed&mdash;clear and majestic&mdash;fine bridge."</p>

<p>It was the only time Burns ever left Scotland,
ever came into England. And here he knelt
down, on the green lawn, and prayed the prayer
that closes "The Cotter's Saturday Night"&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"O Thou who pour'd the patriot tide<br />
That streamed through Wallace's undaunted heart,<br />
Who dared to nobly stem tyrannic pride<br />
Or nobly die, the second glorious part,<br />
(The patriot's God, peculiarly Thou art,<br />
His friend, inspirer, guardian and reward!)<br />
O never, never, Scotia's realm desert;<br />
But still the patriot and the patriot bard,<br />
In bright succession raise, her ornament and guard!"<br />
</p>

<p>Surely a consecration of this crossing after
its centuries of unrest.</p>

<p>General Monk spent the winter of 1659 in
Coldstream, lodging in a house east of the mar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>ket-place,
marked with its tablet. And here he
raised the first of the still famous Coldstream
Guards, to bring King Charles "o'er the water"
back to the throne. Coldstream is the Gretna
Green of this end of the Border, and many a
runaway couple, noble and simple, has been
married in the inn.</p>

<p>Four miles south of Coldstream in a lonely
part of this lonely Border&mdash;almost the echoes
are stilled, and you hear nothing but remembered
bits of Marmion as you walk the highway&mdash;lies
Flodden Field. It was the greatest
of Scotch battles, not even excepting Bannockburn;
greatest because the Scotch are greatest
in defeat.</p>

<p>It was, or so it seemed to James, because his
royal brother-in-law Henry VIII was fighting
in France, an admirable time wherein to advance
into England. James had received a ring
and a glove and a message, from Anne of Brittany,
bidding him</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Strike three strokes with Scottish brand</span><br />
And march three miles on Scottish land<br />
And bid the banners of his band<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In English breezes dance."</span><br />
</p>

<p>James was not the one to win at Flodden,
notwithstanding that he had brought a hundred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
thousand men to his standard. They were content
to raid the Border, and he to dally at Ford.</p>

<p class="poem">
"O for one hour of Wallace wight,<br />
Or well skill'd Bruce to rule the fight,<br />
And cry&mdash;'Saint Andrew and our right!'<br />
Another sight had seen that morn<br />
From Fate's dark book a leaf been torn,<br />
And Flodden had been Bannockburn!"<br />
</p>

<p>The very thud of the lines carries you along,
if you have elected to walk through the countryside,
green now and smiling faintly if deserted,
where it was brown and sere in September,
1513. One should be repeating his "Marmion,"
as Scott thought out so many of its lines riding
over this same countryside. It is a splendid,
a lingering battle picture&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"And first the ridge of mingled spears<br />
Above the brightening cloud appears;<br />
And in the smoke the pennon flew,<br />
As in the storm the white sea mew,<br />
Then mark'd they, dashing broad and far,<br />
The broken billows of the war;<br />
And plumed crests of chieftains brave,<br />
Floating like foam upon the wave,<br />
But nought distinct they see.<br />
Wide ranged the battle on the plain;<br />
Spears shook, and falchions flash'd amain,<br />
Fell England's arrow flight like rain,<br />
Crests rose and stooped and rose again<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Wild and disorderly."</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>Thousands were lost on both sides. But the
flower of England was in France, while the
flower of Scotland was here; and slain&mdash;the
king, twelve earls, fifteen lords and chiefs, an
archbishop, the French ambassador, and many
French captains.</p>

<p>You walk back from the Field, and all the
world is changed. The green haughs, the green
woodlands, seem even in the summer sun to be
dun and sere, and those burns which made merry
on the outward way&mdash;can it be that there are
red shadows in their waters? It is not "Marmion"
but Jean Elliott's "Flower of the Forest"
that lilts through the memory&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"Dule and wae was the order sent our lads to the Border,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The English for once by guile won the day;</span><br />
The Flowers of the Forest that foucht aye the foremost,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The pride of our land are cauld in the clay.</span><br />
<br />
"We'll hear nae mair liltin' at the eve milkin',<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Women and bairns are heartless and wae;</span><br />
Sighin' and moanin' on ilka green loanin'&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Flowers of the Forest are a' wede away."</span><br />
</p>

<p>I know not by what alchemy the Scots are
always able to win our sympathy to their historic
tragedies, or why upon such a field as
Flodden, and many another, the tragedy seems
but to have just happened, the loss is as though
of yesterday.</p>

<p class="dropcap">t is possible to enter the Middle Marches

farther from Flodden than does Berwick.
But Flodden is on English soil to-day, and

history and the tragedy, that one would fain
keep them so, and come upon them as did the
kings from David I, or even the Celtic kings
before him, who sought refuge from the bleak
Scottish north in this smiling land of dales and
haughs, of burns and lochs. Not at any moment
could life become monotonous even in this
realm of romance, since the Border was near,
and danger and dispute so imminent, so incessant.</p>

<p>Preferably then one goes from Edinburgh
(even though never does one go from that city,
"mine own romantic town," but with regret;
not even finally when one leaves it and knows
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
one will not return till next time) to Melrose;
as Scottish kings of history and story have
passed before. There was James II going to
the siege of Roxburgh, and not returning; there
was James IV going to the field of Flodden and
not returning; there was James V going to hunt
the deer; there was James VI going up to London
to be king; Mary Queen on that last journey
to the South Countrie; Charles I and
Charles II losing and getting a crown; Charles
III&mdash;let us defy history and call the Bonnie
Prince by his title&mdash;when he went so splendidly
after Prestonpans.</p>

<span class="caption">JAMES II.</span>

<p>It is a royal progress, out of Edinburgh into
the Middle Marches; past Dalkeith where
James IV rode to meet and marry Margaret of
England; past Borthwick, where Queen Mary
spent that strange hot-trod honeymoon with
Bothwell&mdash;of all place of emotion this is the
most difficult to realize, and I can but think
Mary's heart was broken here, and the heartbreak
at Carberry Hill was but an echo of this;
past Lauder, where the nobles of ignoble James
III hung his un-noble favourite from the stone
arch of the bridge; into the level rays of a setting
sun&mdash;always the setting sun throws a more
revealing light than that of noonday over this
Scotland.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<h4><i>Melrose</i></h4>

<p>I remember on my first visit to Melrose, of
course during my first visit to Scotland, I scheduled
my going so as to arrive there in the evening
of a night when the moon would be at the
full. I had seen it shine gloriously on the front
of York, splendidly on the towers of Durham.
What would it not be on fair Melrose, viewed
aright?</p>

<p>I hurried northward, entered Edinburgh only
to convey my baggage, and then closing my eyes
resolutely to all the glory and the memory that
lay about, I went southward through the early
twilight. I could see, would see, nothing before
Melrose.</p>

<p>The gates of the Abbey were, of course,
closed. But I did not wish to enter there until
the magic hour should strike. The country
round about was ineffably lovely in the rose
light of the vanishing day.</p>

<p class="poem">
"Where fair Tweed flows round holy Melrose<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Eildon slopes to the plain."</span><br />
</p>

<p>The Abbey was, of course, the center of
thought continually, and its red-gray walls<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
caught the light of day and the coming shadows
of night in a curious effect which no picture can
report; time has dealt wondrously with this
stone, leaving the rose for the day, the gray for
the night.</p>

<p>I wandered about, stopping in the empty sloping
market-place to look at the Cross, which is
as old as the Abbey; looking at the graveyard
which surrounds the Abbey, where men lie, common
men unsung in Scottish minstrelsy, except
as part of the great hosts, men who heard the
news when it was swift and fresh from Bannockburn,
and Flodden, and Culloden; and
where men and women still insert their mortality
into this immortality&mdash;Elizabeth Clephane
who wrote the "Ninety and Nine" lies there;
and out into the country and down by the Tweed
toward the Holy Pool, the Haly Wheel, to wonder
if when I came again in the middle night, I,
too, should see the white lady rise in mist from
the waters, this lady of Bemersyde who had
loved a monk of Melrose not wisely but very
well, and who drowned herself in this water
where the monk in penance took daily plunges,
come summer, come winter. How often this is
the Middle-Age penalty!</p>

<p>Far across the shimmering green meadows
and through the fragrant orchards came the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
sound of bagpipes&mdash;on this my first evening in
Scotland! And whether or not you care for the
pipes, there is nothing like them in a Scottish
twilight, a first Scottish twilight, to reconstruct
all the Scotland that has been.</p>

<p>The multitudes and the individuals came
trooping back. At a time of famine these very
fields were filled with huts, four thousand of
them, for always the monks had food, and always
they could perform miracles and obtain
food; which they did. That for the early time.
And for the late, the encampment of Leslie's
men in these fields before the day when they
slaughtered Montrose's scant band of royalists
at Philipshaugh, and sent that most splendid
figure in late Scottish history as a fugitive to
the north, and to the scaffold.</p>

<p>I knew that in the Abbey before the high altar
lay the high heart of The Bruce, which had
been carried to Spain and to the Holy Land,
by order of Bruce, since death overtook him before
he could make the pilgrimage. Lord
James Douglass did battle on the way against
the Moslems in southern Spain, where "a Douglass!
a Douglass!" rang in battle clash against
"Allah, illah, allah," and the Douglass himself
was slain. The heart of The Bruce flung
against the infidel, was recovered and sent on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
to Jerusalem, and then back to Melrose. The
body of Douglass was brought back to Scotland,
to St. Bride's church in Douglass, and his heart
also lies before the high altar of Melrose. "In
their death they were not divided."</p>

<p>There lies also buried Michael Scot</p>

<p class="poem">
"Buried on St. Michael's night,<br />
When the bell toll'd one and the moon was bright."<br />
</p>

<p>On such a night as this, I hoped. And Scot
is fit companion for the twilight. This strange
wizard of a strange time was born in Upper
Tweedale, which is the district of Merlin&mdash;the
older wizard lies buried in a green mound near
Drummelzier. Michael traveled the world over,
Oxford, Paris, Bologna, Palermo, Toledo, and
finally, perhaps because his wizardry had sent
him like a wandering Jew from place to place,
back to the Border, his home country, where he
came and served the Evil One. Dante places
him in the Purgatory of those who attempt blasphemously
to tear the veil of the future. The
thirteenth century was not the time in which
to increase knowledge, whether of this world
or the next. Even to-day perhaps we save a
remnant of superstition, and we would not
boast</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"I could say to thee</span><br />
The words that cleft the Eildon hills in three."<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>Very dark against the gathering dark of the
night sky rose the Eildon hills above, cleft in
three by the wizardry of Scot. To that height
on the morrow I should climb, for it is there
that Sir Walter Scott, a later wizard, had carried
our Washington Irving, just a century ago,
and shown him all this Borderland&mdash;which lay
about me under the increasing cover of night.</p>

<p>"I can stand on the Eildon Hill and point out
forty-three places famous in war and verse,"
Sir Walter said to our Irving. "I have brought
you, like a pilgrim in the Pilgrim's Progress,
to the top of the Delectable Mountains, that I
may show you all the goodly regions hereabouts.
Yonder is Lammermuir and Smailholm; and
there you have Galashiels and Torwoodelee and
Gala Water; and in that direction you see
Teviotdale and the Braes of Yarrow; and Ettrick
stream winding along like a silver thread
to throw itself into the Tweed. It may be pertinacity,
but to my eye, these gray hills and all
this wild Border country have beauties peculiar
to themselves. When I have been for some time
in the rich scenery about Edinburgh, which is
like an ornamented garden land, I begin to wish
myself back again among my own honest gray
hills; and if I did not see the heather at least
once a year, I think I should die."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>On the morrow. But for to-night it was
enough to remember that perfect picture as
imagination painted it in Andrew Lang's
verse&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"Three crests against the saffron sky,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beyond the purple plain,</span><br />
The kind remembered melody<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of Tweed once more again.</span><br />
<br />
"Wan water from the Border hills,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dear voice from the old years,</span><br />
Thy distant music lulls and stills,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And moves to quiet tears.</span><br />
<br />
"Like a loved ghost thy fabled flood<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fleets through the dusky land;</span><br />
Where Scott, come home to die, has stood,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My feet returning, stand.</span><br />
<br />
"A mist of memory broods and floats,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Border waters flow;</span><br />
The air is full of ballad notes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Borne out of long ago.</span><br />
<br />
"Old songs that sung themselves to me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sweet through a boy's day dream,</span><br />
While trout below the blossom'd tree<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Plashed in the golden stream.</span><br />
<br />
"Twilight, and Tweed, and Eildon Hill,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fair and too fair you be;</span><br />
You tell me that the voice is still<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That should have welcomed me."</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>I did not miss the voice, any of the voices.
They whispered, they sang, they crooned, they
keened, about me. For this was Melrose, <i>mael
ros</i>, so the old Celtic goes, "the naked headland
in the wood." And I was seeing, was
hearing, what I have come to see and hear; I,
a Scot, if far removed, if in diluted element,
and Scott's from the reading days of Auld Lang
Syne.</p>

<p>And should I not within the moonlight see
the white lady rise from the Haly Wheel? And
should I not see the moonlight flooding the Abbey,
Melrose Abbey? Out of a remembered
yesterday, out of a confident midnight&mdash;surely
there was a budding morrow in this midnight&mdash;I
remembered the lines&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"If thou would'st view fair Melrose aright,<br />
Go visit it by the pale moonlight;<br />
For the gay beams of lightsome day<br />
Gild but to flout the ruins gray.<br />
When the broken arches are black in night,<br />
And each shafted oriel glimmers white,<br />
When the cold light's uncertain shower<br />
Streams on the ruined central tower;<br />
When buttress and buttress alternately<br />
Seem framed of ebon and ivory;<br />
When silver edges the imagery,<br />
And the scrolls that teach thee to live and die;<br />
When distant Tweed is heard to rave,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>And the owlet to hoot o'er the dead man's grave,<br />
Then go&mdash;but go alone the while&mdash;<br />
Then view St. David's ruined pile;<br />
And, home returning, soothly swear<br />
Was never scene so sad and fair."<br />
</p>

<p>The moon did not rise that night.</p>

<p>I walked about the fields, lingered about the
Cross in the market, looked expectantly at the
Abbey, until two in the morning.</p>

<p class="poem">
"It was near the ringing of matin bell,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The night was well nigh done."</span><br />
</p>

<p>The moon did not rise, and neither did the
white lady. It was not because there was a
mist, a Scottish mist, over the heavens; they
were clear, the stars were shining, and the pole
star held true, Charles' wain&mdash;as Charles should
in Bonnie Scotland&mdash;held true to the pole. But
it was a late July moon, and those Eildon hills
and their circling kin rose so high against the
night sky&mdash;daytime they seemed modest enough&mdash;that
the moon in this latitude as far north as
Sitka did not circle up the sky. Neither does
the sun in winter, so the guardian explained to
me next day.</p>

<p>Fair Melrose is fairest, o' nights, at some
later or earlier time of the year. It was then
that I resolved to return in December, on December
27, when the festival of St. John's is
celebrated with torch lights in the ruins of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
Abbey&mdash;and Michael Scot comes back to his
own! But then I reflected that the moon is not
always full on the Eve of St. John's.</p>

<p class="poem">
"I cannot come, I must not come,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I dare not come to thee,</span><br />
On the Eve of St. John's, I must walk alone,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In thy bower I may not be."</span><br />
</p>

<p>I chose, years later, an October moon, in
which to see it "aright."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i058.jpg" width="600" height="377" alt="MELROSE ABBEY." title="" />
<span class="caption">MELROSE ABBEY.</span>
</div>

<p>Viewed by day, Melrose is surely fair; fair
enough to enchant mortal vision. It is the loveliest
ruin in the land where reform has meant
ruin, and where from Kelso to Elgin, shattered
fanes of the faith proclaim how variable is the
mind of man through the generations, and how
hostile when it forsakes.</p>

<p>Melrose is an old foundation. In truth the
monastery was established at old Melrose, two
miles farther down the Tweed, and is so lovely,
so dramatic a corner of the Tweed, that Dorothy
Woodsworth declared, "we wished we could
have brought the ruins of Melrose to this spot."
She missed the nearby murmur of the river as
we do.</p>

<p>This oldest harbour of Christianity was
founded in the pagan world by monks from
Iona. Therefore by way of Ireland and not
from Rome, blessed by Saint Columba sixty
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
years before Saint Augustine came to Canterbury.
It was the chief "island" between Iona
and Lindisfarne. Very haughty were these
monks of the West. "Rome errs, Alexandria
errs, all the world errs; only the Scots and the
Britons are in the right." There is surely
something still left of the old spirit in Scotia,
particularly in spiritual Scotia.</p>

<p>Near Melrose was born that Cuthbert who
is the great saint of the North, either side the
Border, and who lies in the midst of the splendour
of Durham. A shepherd, he watched his
sheep on these very hills round about us, and
saw, when abiding in the fields, angels ascending
and descending on golden ladders. Entering
Melrose as a novice he became prior in 664,
and later prior at Lindisfarne. When the
monks were driven from the Holy Island by the
Danes they carried the body of St. Cuthbert
with them for seven years, and once it rested
at Melrose&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"O'er northern mountain, march and moor,<br />
From sea to sea, from shore to shore,<br />
Seven years St. Cuthbert's corpse they bore,<br />
They rested them in fair Melrose;<br />
But though alive he loved it well,<br />
Not there his relics might repose."<br />
</p>

<p>When King David came to the making of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
Scotland, he came into the Middle Marches, and
finding them very lovely&mdash;even as you and I&mdash;this
"sair sanct to the Croon," as his Scottish
royal descendant, James VI saw him&mdash;and
James would have fell liked to be a saint, but
he could accomplish neither sinner nor saint,
because Darnley crossed Mary in his veins&mdash;David
determined to build him fair Abbeys.
Of which, Melrose, "St. David's ruined pile,"
is the fairest. He brought Cistercians from
Rievaulx in Yorkshire, to supplant the Culdees
of Iona, and they builded them a beautiful stone
Melrose to supplant the wooden huts of old
Melrose. It centered a very active monastic
life, where pavements were once smooth and
lawns were close-clipped, and cowled monks in
long robes served God, and their Abbot lorded
it over lords, even equally with kings.</p>

<p>But it stood on the highway between Dunfermline
and London, between English and Scottish
ambitions. And it fell before them. Edward I
spared it because the Abbots gave him fealty.
But Edward II, less royal in power and in taste,
destroyed it. The Bruce rebuilded it again,
greater splendour rising out of complete ruin.
When Richard II came to Scotland he caused
the Abbey to be pillaged and burned. And when
Hertford came for Henry VIII, after the Thirty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
Nine Articles had annulled respect for buildings
under the protection of Rome, the final
ruin came to St. David's church-palace. Yet,
late as 1810, church service, reformed, of
course, was held in a roofed-over part of the
Abbey ruin. To-day it is under the protection
of the Dukes of Buccleuch. And, we remember
as we stand here, while the beams of lightsome
day gild the ruin, the mottoes of the great family
of the Border, <i>Luna Cornua Reparabit</i>,
which being interpreted is, "There'll be moonlight
again." Then to light the raids, the reiving
that refilled the larder. But to-morrow for
scenic effect.</p>

<p>Examined in this daylight, the beauty of Melrose
surely loses very little. It is one of the
most exquisite ruins in the United Kingdom,
perhaps second to Tintern, but why compare?
It is of finest Gothic, out of France, not out of
England. In its general aspect it is nobly
magnificent&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"The darken'd roof rose high aloof<br />
On pillars, lofty, light and small;<br />
The keystone that locked each ribbed aisle<br />
Was a fleur de lys or a quatre feuille,<br />
The corbels were carved grotesque and grim;<br />
And the pillars with clustered shafts so trim,<br />
With base and with capital flourish'd around<br />
Seem'd bundles of lances which garlands had bound."<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>And, as a chief detail which yields not to
Tintern or any other, is the east window over
the high altar, through which the moon and sun
shines on those buried hearts&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"The moon on the east oriel shone<br />
Through slender shafts of shapely stone,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By foliaged tracery combined.</span><br />
Thou would'st have thought some fairy'd hand<br />
'Twixt poplars straight the osier wand<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In many a freakish knot had twined,</span><br />
Then framed a spell when the work was done,<br />
And changed the willow wreaths to stone.<br />
The silver light, so pale and faint,<br />
Showed many a prophet and many a saint,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whose image on the glass was dyed,</span><br />
Full in the midst his cross of red<br />
Triumphant Michael brandish'd,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And trampled on the Apostate's pride;</span><br />
The moonbeams kissed the holy pane,<br />
And threw on the pavement a bloody stain."<br />
</p>


<h4><i>Abbotsford</i></h4>

<p>If "Scott restored Scotland," he built the
"keep" which centers all the Scott-land of the
Border side.</p>

<p>Two miles above Melrose, a charming walk
leads to Abbotsford; redeemed out of a swamp
into at least the most memory-filled mansion
of all the land. Scott, like the monks, could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
not leave the silver wash of the Tweed; and,
more loving than those who dwelt at Melrose
and Dryburgh, he placed his Abbot's House
where the rippling sound was within a stone's
throw.</p>

<p>The Tweed is such a storied stream that as
you walk along, sometimes across sheep-cropped
meadows, sometimes under the fragant rustling
bough and athwart the shifting shadows
of oak, ash, and thorn&mdash;Puck of Pook's hill
must have known the Border country in its most
embroidered days&mdash;you cannot tell whether or
not the deep quiet river is the noblest you have
seen, or the storied hills about are less than
the Delectable mountains.</p>

<p>The name "Tweed" suggests romance&mdash;unless
instead of having read your Scott you have
come to its consciousness through the homespun,
alas, to-day too often the factory-spun
woolens, which are made throughout all Scotland,
but still in greatest length on Tweedside.</p>

<p>Dorothy Wordsworth, winsome marrow, who
loved the country even better than William, I
trow&mdash;only why remark it when he himself
recognized how his vision was quickened
through her companionship?&mdash;has spoke the
word Tweed&mdash;"a name which has been sweet in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
my ears almost as far back as I can remember
anything."</p>

<p>The river comes from high in the Cheviot
hills, where East and West Marches merge and
where&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"Annan, Tweed, and Clyde<br />
Rise a' out o' ae hillside."<br />
</p>

<p>And down to the sea it runs, its short hundred
miles of story&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"All through the stretch of the stream,<br />
To the lap of Berwick Bay."<br />
</p>

<p>As you walk along Tweedside, you feel its enchantment,
you feel the sorrow of the thousands
who through the centuries have exiled themselves
from its banks, because of war, or because
of poverty, or because of love&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"Therefore I maun wander abroad,<br />
And lay my banes far frae the Tweed."<br />
</p>

<p>But now, you are returned, you are on your
way to Abbotsford, there are the Eildons,
across the river you get a glimpse of the Catrail,
that sunken way that runs along the boundary
for one-half its length, and may have
been a fosse, or may have been a concealed road
of the Romans or what not. Scott once leaped
his horse across it, nearly lost his life, and did
lose his confidence in his horsemanship.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p class="poem">
"And all through the summer morning<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I felt it a joy indeed</span><br />
To whisper again and again to myself,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This is the voice of the Tweed."</span><br />
</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i068.jpg" width="600" height="432" alt="Abbotsford" title="" />
<span class="caption1">Abbotsford</span>
</div>

<p>It is not possible to approach Abbotsford, as
it should be approached, from the riverside, the
view with which one is familiar, the view the
pictures carry. Or, it can be done if one would
forego the walk, take it in the opposite direction,
and come hither by rail from Galashiels&mdash;that
noisy modern factory town, once the housing
place for Melrose pilgrims, which to-day speaks
nothing of the romance of Gala water, and
surely not these factory folk "can match the
lads o' Gala Water." It is a short journey,
and railway journeys are to be avoided in this
land of by-paths. But there, across the water,
looking as the pictures have it, and as Scott
would have it, rises Abbotsford, turreted and
towered, engardened and exclusive.</p>

<p>It stands on low level ground, for it is redeemed
out of a duckpond, out of Clarty hole.
Sir Walter wished to possess the Border, or
as much of it as might be, so he made this first
purchase of a hundred acres in 1811. As he
wrote to James Ballantyne&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have resolved to purchase a piece of
ground sufficient for a cottage and a few fields.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
There are two pieces, either of which would suit
me, but both would make a very desirable property
indeed, and could be had for between
7,000 and 8,000 pounds, or either separate for
about half that sum. I have serious thoughts
of one or both."</p>

<p>He began with one, and fourteen years later,
when the estate had extended to a thousand
acres, to the inclusion of many fields, sheep-cropped
and story-haunted, he entered in his
diary&mdash;</p>

<p>"Abbotsford is all I can make it, so I am resolved
on no more building, and no purchases
of land till times are more safe."</p>

<p>By that time the people of the countryside
called him "the Duke," he had at least been
knighted, and was, in truth, the Chief of the
Border; a royal ambition which I doubt not he
cherished from those first days when he read
Percy under a platanus.</p>

<p>He paid fabulous prices for romantic spots,
and I think would have bought the entire
Border if the times had become safer, in those
scant seven years that were left to him.
Even Scott could be mistaken, for he bought
what he believed was Huntlie Bank, where
True Thomas had his love affair with the fair
ladye<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"True Thomas lay on Huntlie Bank;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A ferlie he spied wi' his e'e;</span><br />
And there he saw a ladye bright<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Come riding down by the Eildon tree.</span><br />
<br />
"Her skirt was o' the grass-green silk,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her mantle o' the velvet fyne;</span><br />
At ilka tett o' her horse's mane<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hung fifty siller bells and nine."</span><br />
</p>

<p>And now the experts tell us that it is not
Huntlie Bank at all, but that is in an entirely
different direction, over toward Ercildoune and
the Rhymer's Tower.</p>

<p>There is a satisfaction in this to those of us
who believe in fairies and in Scott. For fairies
have no sense of place or of time. And of
course if they knew that Scott wished them to
have lived at his Huntlie Bank, they straightway
would have managed to have lived there.
Always, as you go through this land of romance,
or any romance land, and wise dull folk dispute,
you can console yourself that Scott also was
mistaken(?).</p>

<p>The castle began with a small cottage, not
this great pile of gray stone we can see from
the railway carriage across the Tweed, into
which we make our humble way through a
wicket gate, a restrained walk, and a basement
doorway. "My dreams about my cottage go<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
on," he wrote to Joanna Baillie, as we all dream
of building cottages into castles. "My present
intention is to have only two spare bedrooms,"
but "I cannot relinquish my Border
principles of accommodating all the cousins and
duniwastles, who will rather sleep on chairs,
and on the floor, and in the hay-loft, than be absent
when folks are gathered together."</p>

<p>So we content ourselves with being duniwastles,
whatever that may be, and are confident
that Sir Walter if he were alive would give us
the freedom of the castle.</p>

<p>In any event, if we feel somewhat robbed of
any familiar intercourse, we can remember that
Ruskin called this "perhaps the most incongruous
pile that gentlemanly modernism ever designed."
This may content the over-sensitive
who are prevented ever hearing the ripple of
the Tweed through the windows.</p>

<p>Scott was a zealous relic hunter, and if you
like relics, if you can better conjure up persons
through a sort of transubstantiation of personality
that comes by looking on what the great
have possessed, there can be few private collections
more compelling than this of Abbotsford.</p>

<p>In the library are such significant hints for
reconstruction as the blotting book wherewith
Napoleon cleared his record, the crucifix on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
which Queen Mary prayed, the quaigh of her
great great and last grandson, the tumbler from
which Bobbie Burns drank&mdash;one of them&mdash;the
purse into which Rob Roy thrust his plunder,
the pocket book of Flora MacDonald, which held
nothing I fear from the generosity of the Bonnie
Prince.</p>

<p>In the armoury are Scott's own gun, Rob
Roy's gun, dirk and skene dhu, the sword of
Montrose, given to that last of the great Cavaliers
by his last king, Charles I, the pistol of
Claverhouse, the pistol of Napoleon, a hunting
flask of James III; and here are the keys of
Loch Leven castle, dropped in the lake by Mary
Queen's boatman; and the keys of the Edinburgh
Tolbooth turned on so many brave men,
yes, and fair women, in the old dividing days,
of Jacobite and Covenanter.</p>

<p>The library of Scott, twenty thousand volumes,
still lines the shelves, and one takes particular
interest in this place, and its little stairway
whereby ascent is made to the balcony, also
book-lined, and escape through a little doorway.
When Scott first came to the cottage of Abbotsford
he wrote, furiously, in a little window
embrasure with only a curtain between him and
the domestic world. Here he had not only a
library, but a study, where still stands the desk<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
at which the Waverleys were written, and the
well-worn desk chair.</p>

<p>After he had returned from Italy, whither he
went in search of health and did not find it, he
felt, one day, a return of the old desire to
write, the ruling passion. He was wheeled to
the desk, he took the pen,&mdash;nothing came. He
sank back and burst into tears. As Lockhart
reports it&mdash;"It was like Napoleon resigning his
empire. The scepter had departed from Judah;
Scott was to write no more."</p>

<p>Scott has always seemed like a contemporary.
Not because of his novels; I fear the Waverleys
begin to read a little stilted to the young generation,
and there are none left to lament with
Lowell that he had read all of Scott and now he
could never read him all over again for the first
time. It is rather because Scott the man is so
immortal that he seems like a man still living;
or at least like one who died but yesterday.
Into the dining-room where we cannot go&mdash;and
perhaps now that we think it over it is as well&mdash;he
was carried in order that out of it he might
look his last on "twilight and Tweed and Eildon
hill." And there he died, even so long ago as
September, 1832.</p>

<p>"It was a beautiful day," that day we seem
almost to remember as we stand here in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
vivid after glow, "so warm that every window
was wide open, and so peacefully still that the
sound of all others most delicious to his ear, the
gentle ripple of the Tweed, was distinctly
audible."</p>


<h4><i>Dryburgh</i></h4>

<p>Five days after they carried him to rest in
the Abbey&mdash;rival certainly in this instance of
The Abbey of England, where is stored so much
precious personal dust. The time had become
thrawn; dark skies hung over the Cheviots and
the Eildon, and over the haughs of Ettrick and
Yarrow; the silver Tweed ran leaden, and
moaned in its going; there was a keening in
the wind.</p>

<p>The road from Abbotsford past Melrose to
Dryburgh is&mdash;perhaps&mdash;the loveliest walk in
the United Kingdom; unless it be the road from
Coventry past Kenilworth to Stratford. It was
by this very way that there passed the funeral
train of Scott, the chief carriage drawn by
Scott's own horses. Thousands and thousands
of pilgrims have followed that funeral train;
one goes to Holy Trinity in Stratford, to the
Invalides in Paris, but one walks to Dryburgh<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
through the beautiful Tweedside which is all
a shrine to Sir Walter.</p>

<p>The road runs away from the river to the
little village of Darnick, with its ivy-shrouded
tower, across the meadows to the bridge across
the river, with the ringing of bells in the ear.
For it was ordered on that September day of
1832, by the Provost, "that the church bell shall
toll from the time the funeral procession
reaches Melrose Bridge till it passes the village
of Newstead."</p>

<p>I do not suppose the people of this countryside,
who look at modern pilgrims so sympathetically,
so understandingly, have ever had
time to forget; the stream of pilgrims has
been so uninterrupted for nearly a century.
Through the market-place of Melrose it passed,
the sloping stony square, where people of the
village pass and repass on their little village
errands. And it did not stop at the Abbey.</p>

<p>The day was thickening into dusk then; it
is ripening into sunset glory to-day. And the
Abbey looks very lovely, and very lonely. And
one wonders if Michael Scot did not call to
Walter Scott to come and join the quiet there,
and if the dust that once was the heart of Bruce
did not stir a little as the recreator of Scotland
was carried by.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>To the village of Newstead you move on; with
the sound of immemorial bells falling on the
ear, and pass through the little winding street&mdash;and
wonder if the early Roman name of
Trimontium, triple mountains, triple Eildon,
was its first call name out of far antiquity as
Scott believed.</p>

<p>Then the road ascends between hedgerows,
and begins to follow the Tweed closely&mdash;and
perhaps you meet pilgrims on Leaderfoot
bridge who have come the wrong way. There
is a steep climb to the heights of Bemersyde,
where on the crest all Melrose Glen lies beautifully
storied before you. And here you pause&mdash;as
did those horses of Scott's, believing their
master would fain take one last look at his favourite
view.</p>

<p>There is no lovelier landscape in the world,
or in Scotland. The blue line of the Cheviots
bars back the world, the Dunion, the Ruberslaw,
the Eildon rise, and in the great bend of the
river with richly wooded braes about is the site
of Old Melrose. Small wonder he paused to
take farewell of all the country he had loved
so well.</p>

<p>The road leads on past Bemersyde village
with woodlands on either side, and to the east,
near a little loch, stands Sandyknowe Tower.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>Near the tower lies the remnant of the village
of Smailholm, where Scott was sent out of
Edinburgh when only three years old. It is in
truth his birthplace, for without the clear air
of the Border he would have followed the other
Scott children; and without the romance of the
Border he might have been merely a barrister.</p>

<p>Sandyknowe is brave in spite of its ruin, for
it is built of the very stone of the eternal hills,
and has become part of the hills. From its balcony,
sixty feet high, a beautiful Scottish panorama
may be glimpsed, and here Scott brought
Turner to make his sketch of the Border. And
here, because a kinsman agreed to save Sandyknowe
Tower from the mortality that comes
even to stone if Scott would write a ballad and
make it immortal, is laid the scene of "Eve of
St. John's"&mdash;with these last haunting intangible
lines&mdash;</p>

There is a monk in Melrose tower<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He speaketh a word to none."</span><br />
</p>

<p>Then, back to the Tweed, where the river
sweeps out in a great circle, and leaves a peninsula
for Dryburgh. The gray walls of the ruin
lift above the thick green of the trees; yew and
oak and sycamore close in the fane.</p>

</div>

<p>Druid and Culdee and Roman have built
shrines in this lovely spot, but to-day pilgrimage
is made chiefly because in the quiet sheltered
ruined St. Mary's aisle sleeps Sir Walter.
It would make one-half in love with death to
think of being buried in so sweet a place.</p>

<p>Dryburgh is also one of St. David's foundations,
in the "sacred grove of oaks," the Darach
Bruach of the worship that is older than Augustus
or Columba. These were white monks that
David brought up from Alnwick where his
queen had been a Northumbrian princess, and
their white cloaks must have seemed, among
these old old oaks, but the white robes of the
Druids come back again.</p>

<p>It is a well-kept place, vines covering over the
crumbling gray stone, kept by the Lords of
Buchan. And, perhaps too orderly, too fanciful,
too "improved"; one likes better the acknowledged
ruin of Melrose, and one would
prefer that Sir Walter were there with his kin,
instead of here with his kindred. But this is a
sweet place, a historic place, begun by Hugh de
Moreville, who was a slayer of Thomas &agrave; Becket,
and was Constable of Scotland. His tomb is
marked by a double circle on the floor of the
Chapter House, and there is nothing of the
Chapter House; it is open to beating rain and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
scorching sun&mdash;fit retribution for his most foul
deed.</p>

<h4><i>Kelso</i></h4>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 68px;">
<img src="images/letter-i.jpg" width="68" height="75" alt="I" title="I" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">t is a very great little country which lies
all about Melrose, with never a bend of
the river or a turn of the highway or
a shoulder of the hill, nay, scarce the shadow
of any hazel bush or the piping of any wee bird
but has its history, but serves to recall what
once was; and because the countryside is so
teeming seems to make yesterday one with to-day.
The distances are very short, even between
the places the well-read traveler knows;
with many places that are new along the way,
each haunted with its tradition, soon to haunt
the traveler, while the people he meets would
seem to have been here since the days of the
Winged Hats.</p>

<p>Perhaps in order to get into the center of
the ecclesiastical country&mdash;for after this being
a Borderland, and a Scott-land, it is decidedly
Abbots-land, even before Abbotsford came into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
being with its new choice of old title&mdash;the traveler
will take train to Kelso, or walk there, a
scant dozen miles from Melrose.</p>

<p>The journey is down the Tweed, which opens
ever wider between the gentle hills that are
more and more rounding as the flow goes on to
the sea. There is not such intense loneliness;
here is the humanest part of the Scottish landscape,
and while even on this highway the cottages
are not frequent, and one eyes the journeymen
with as close inspection as one is eyed,
still it is a friendly land. The southern burr&mdash;we
deliberately made excuse of drinking water
or asking direction in order to hear it&mdash;is softer
than in the North; yet, you would not mistake
it for Northumberland. We wondered if this
was the accent Scott spoke with; but to him must
have belonged all the dialect-voices.</p>

<p>It was at Roxburgh Castle that King David
lived when he determined to build these abbeys
of the Middle Marches, of which the chief four
are Melrose, Dryburgh, Jedburgh and Kelso,
with Holyrood as their royal keystone.</p>

<p>Roxburgh was a stronghold of the Border,
and therefore met the fate of those strongholds,
when one party was stronger than the other;
usually the destruction was by the English because
they were farther away and could hold<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
the country only through making it desolate.</p>

<p>Who would not desire loveliness and desire
to fix it in stone, if he lived in such a lovely
spot as this where the Tweed and Teviot meet?
David had been in England. He was brother
to the English queen Maude, wife of Henry I,
and had come in contact with the Norman culture.
Or, as William of Malmesbury put it,
with that serene assurance of the Englishman
over the Scot, he "had been freed from the rust
of Scottish barbarity, and polished from a boy
from his intercourse and familiarity with us."
Ah, welladay! if residence at the English court
and Norman culture resulted in these lovely abbeys,
let us be lenient with William of Malmesbury.
Incidentally David added to the Scotland
of that time certain English counties,
Northumberland and Cumberland and Westmoreland&mdash;as
well as English culture!</p>

<p>David was son to Saxon Margaret, St. Margaret,
and from her perhaps the "sair sanct"
inherited some of his gentleness. But also he
had married Matilda of Northumberland,
wealthy and a widow, and he preferred to remain
on the highway to London rather than at
Dunfermline. So he was much at Roxburgh.</p>

<p>But the castle did not remain in Scottish or
English hands. It was while curiously inter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>ested
in a great Flemish gun that James II was
killed by the explosion&mdash;and the siege of Roxburgh
went on more hotly, and the castle was
razed to its present low estate.</p>

<p>To-day the silly sheep are cropping grass
about the scant stones that once sheltered kings
and defied them; and ash trees are the sole occupants
of the once royal dwelling. To the
American there is something of passing interest
in the present seat of the Duke of Roxburgh,
Floors castle across the Teviot. For the house,
like many another Scottish house, still carries
direct descent. And an heiress from America,
like the heiress from Northumberland, unites
her fortune with this modern splendour&mdash;and
admits Americans and others on Wednesdays!</p>

<p>The town of Kelso is charming, like many
Tweed towns. It lies among the wooded hills;
there is a greater note of luxury here. Scott
called it "the most beautiful if not the most
romantic village in Scotland." Seen from the
bridge which arches the flood, that placid flood
of Tweed, and a five-arched bridge ambitiously
and successfully like the Waterloo bridge of
London, one wonders if after all perhaps
Wordsworth wrote his Bridge sonnet here&mdash;"Earth
hath not anything to show more fair."
Surely this bridge, these spires and the great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
tower of the Abbey, "wear the beauty of the
morning," the morning of the world. The
hills, luxuriously wooded, rise gently behind,
the persistent Eildons hang over, green meadows
are about, the silver river runs&mdash;and the
skies are Scottish skies, whether blue or gray.</p>

<p>The Abbey, of course, is the crown of the
place, bolder in design and standing more boldly
in spite of the havoc wrought by men and time,
and Hertford and Henry VIII; calmer than
Melrose, less ornamental, with its north portal
very exquisite in proportion.</p>

<p>The Abbot of Kelso was in the palmy early
days chief ecclesiastic of Scotland, a spiritual
lord, receiving his miter from the Pope, and
armoured with the right to excommunicate.</p>

<p>There have been other kings here than David
and the Abbot. The latter days of the Stewarts
are especially connected with Kelso, so near
the Border. Baby James was hurried hither
and crowned in the cathedral as the III after
Roxburgh. Mary Queen lodged here for two
nights before she rode on to Berwick. Here in
the ancient market-place, looking like the square
of a continental town, the Old Chevalier was
proclaimed King James VIII on an October
Monday in 1715, and the day preceding the English
chaplain had preached to the troops from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
the text&mdash;"The right of the first born is his."
Quite differently minded from that Whig minister
farther north, who later prayed "as for
this young man who has come among us seeking
an earthly crown, may it please Thee to bestow
upon him a heavenly one."</p>

<p>When this Rising of the Forty Five came,
and he who should have been Charles III (according
to those of us who are Scottish, and
royalist, and have been exiled because of our
allegiance) attempted to secure the throne for
his father, he established his headquarters at
Sunilaw just outside Kelso; the house is in
ruins, but a white rose that he planted still
bears flowers. To the citizens of Kelso who
drank to him, the Prince, keeping his head, and
having something of his royal great uncle's
gift of direct speech, replied, "I believe you,
gentlemen, I believe you. I have drinking
friends, but few fighting ones in Kelso."</p>

<p>Scott knew Kelso from having lived here,
from going to school here, and it was in out of
the Kelso library&mdash;where they will show you
the very copy&mdash;that he first read Percy's
Reliques.</p>

<p>"I remember well the spot ... it was beneath
a huge platanus, in the ruins of what
had been intended for an old fashioned arbour<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
in the garden.... The summer day had sped
onward so fast that notwithstanding the sharp
appetite of thirteen, I forgot the dinner hour.
The first time I could scrape together a few
shillings I bought unto myself a copy of the
beloved volumes; nor do I believe I ever read
a book half so frequently or with half the enthusiasm."</p>

<p>Was it not a nearer contemporary to Percy,
and a knight of romance, Sir Philip Sidney, who
said, "I never read the old song of Percie and
Douglas that I found not my heart moved more
than with a trumpet"?</p>

<p>For myself I have resolutely refused to identify
the word, Platanus, lest it should not be
identical with the spot where I first read my
Percy.</p>

<p>Scott also knew Kelso as the place of his first
law practice, and of his honeymoon. Here
flowered into maturity that long lavish life, so
enriched and so enriching of the Border.</p>

<p>Horatio Bonar was minister here for thirty
years&mdash;I wondered if he wrote here, "I was a
wandering sheep."</p>

<p>While James Thomson, who wrote "The
Seasons," but also "Rule, Britannia"&mdash;if he
was a Scotsman; perhaps this was an Act of
Union<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">

Britons never will be slaves!"<br />
</p>

<p class="noidt">was born at a little village nearby, back in the
low hills of Tweed, in 1700, seven years before
the Union.</p>


<h4><i>Jedburgh</i></h4>

<p>From Kelso I took train to the Border town
which even the Baedeker admits has had "a
stormy past," and where the past still lingers;
nay, not lingers, but is; there is no present in
Jedburgh. It is but ten miles to the Border;
more I think that at any other point in all the
blue line of the Cheviot, is one conscious of the
Border; consciousness of antiquity and of geography
hangs over Jedburgh.</p>

<p>It lies, a hill town, on the banks of the Jed;
"sylvan Jed" said Thomson, "crystal Jed"
said Burns; a smaller stream than the Tweed,
more tortuous, swifter, rushing through wilder
scenery, tumultuous, vocative, before Border
times began&mdash;if ever there were such a time
before&mdash;and disputatious still to remind us that
this is still a division in the kingdom.</p>

<p>One of the most charming walks in all Scotland&mdash;and
I do not know of any country where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
foot-traveler's interest is so continuous (I
wrote this before I had read the disastrous
walking trip of the Pennell's)&mdash;is up this valley
of the Jed a half dozen miles, where remnants of
old forest, or its descendants, still stand, where
the bracken is thick enough to conceal an army
crouching in ambush, where the hills move
swiftly up from the river, and break sharply
into precipices, with crumbling peel towers,
watch towers, to guard the heights, and where
outcropping red scars against the hill mark
sometimes the entrance to caves that must have
often been a refuge when Border warfare
tramped down the valley.</p>

<p>In Jedburgh we lodged not at the inn; although
the name of Spread Eagle much attracted
us; but because every one who had come
before us had sought lodging, we, too, would
"lodge," if it be but for a night.</p>

<p>Mary Queen had stayed at an old house, still
standing in Queenstreet, Prince Charles at a
house in Castlegate, Burns in the Canongate,
the Wordsworths, William and Dorothy, in
Abbey Close, because there was no room in
the inn. I do not know if it were the Spread
Eagle then, but the assizes were being held,
Jethart justice was being administered, or,
juster justice, since these were more parlous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
times, and parley went before sentence. Scott as
a sheriff and the other officials of the country
were filling the hostelry. But Sir Walter, then
the Sheriff of Selkirk, sheriff being a position
of more "legality" than with us, and no doubt
remembering his first law case which he had
pled at Jedburgh years before, came over to
Abbey Close after dinner, and according to
Dorothy Wordsworth "sate with us an hour or
two, and repeated a part of the 'Lay of the Last
Minstrel.'"</p>

<p>Think of not knowing whether it was an hour
or two hours, with Scott repeating the "Lay,"
and in Jedburgh.</p>

<p>We lodged in a little narrow lane, near the
Queen in the Backgate, with a small quaint garden
plot behind; there would be pears in season,
and many of them, ripening against these
stone walls. The pears of the Border are
famous. Our landlady was removed from
Yetholm only a generation. Yetholm is the
gipsy capital of this countryside. And we wondered
whether Meg Faa, for so she ambitiously
called herself, by the royal name of Scottish
Romany, was descended from Meg Merrilies.
Mrs. Faa had dark flashing eyes in a thin dark
face, and they flashed like a two-edged dagger.
She was a small woman, scarce taller than
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
a Jethart ax as we had seen them in the museum
at Kelso. I should never have dared to ask
her about anything, not even the time of day,
and, in truth, like many of the Scotch women,
she had a gift of impressive silence. All the
night I had a self-conscious feeling that something
was going to happen in this town of Jed,
and in the morning when I met Mrs. Faa again
and her eyes rather than her voice challenged
me as to how I had slept, I should not have
dared admit that I slept with one eye open
lest I become one more of the permanent ghosts
of Jed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i096.jpg" width="600" height="344" alt="JEDBURGH ABBEY." title="" />
<span class="caption">JEDBURGH ABBEY.</span>
</div>

<p>The Abbey is, in its way, its individual way,
most interesting of the chief four of "St.
David's piles." It is beautifully lodged, beside
the Jed, near the stream, and the stream
more a part of its landscape; smooth-shaven
English lawns lie all about, a veritable ecclesiastical
close. It is simpler than Melrose,
if the detail is not so marvelous, and there is
substantially more of it. The Norman tower
stands square; if witches still dance on it they
choose their place for security. The long
walls of the nave suggest almost a restoration&mdash;almost.</p>

<p>When the Abbey flourished, and when Alexander
III was king, he was wedded here (1285)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
to Joleta, daughter of the French Count de
Dreux. Always French and Scotch have felt
a kinship, and often expressed it in royal marriage.
The gray abbey walls, then a century
and a half old, must have looked curiously down
on this gay wedding throng which so possessed
the place, so dispossessed the monks, Austin
friars come from the abbey of St. Quentin at
Beauvais.</p>

<p>Suddenly, in the midst of the dance, the King
reached out his hand to the maiden queen&mdash;and
Death, the specter, met him with skeleton
fingers. It may have been a pageant trick, it
may have been a too thoughtful monk; but the
thirteenth century was rich with superstition.
Six months later Alexander fell from his horse
on a stormy night on the Fife coast&mdash;and
the prophetic omen was remembered, or constructed.</p>

<p>The Abbey was newly in ruin when Mary
Queen rode down this way, only twenty-one
years after Hertford's hurtful raid. Court was
to be held here, the assizes of October, 1566, at
this Border town. For the Border had been
over-lively and was disputing the authority of
the Scottish queen as though it had no loyalty.
Bothwell had been sent down as Warden of the
Marches to quell the marauding free-booters.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
He had met with Little Jock Elliott, a Jethart
callant, a Border bandit, to whom we can forgive
much, because of the old ballad.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 3em;">An' wha daur meddle wi' me?</span><br />
<br />
"I munt my gude naig wi' a will<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When the fray's in the wind, an' he</span><br />
Cocks his lugs as he tugs for the hill<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That enters the south countrie,</span><br />
Where pricking and spurring are rife,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the bluid boils up like the sea,</span><br />
But the Southrons gang doon i' the strife,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">An' wha daur meddle wi' me?"</span><br />
</p>

<p>And perhaps we can forgive the reiver, since
he dealt a blow to Bothwell that those of us who
love Mary have longed to strike through the
long centuries. Bothwell took Elliott in custody,
Elliott not suspecting that a Scot could
prove treacherous like a Southron, and was
carrying him to the Hermitage. Jock asked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
pleasantly what would be his fate at the assize.</p>

</div>

<p>"Gif ane assyises wald mak him clene, he was
hertlie contentit, but he behuvit to pas to the
Quenis grace."</p>

<p>This was little promise to little Jock Elliott.
He fled. Bothwell chased. Bothwell fired,
wounded Jock, overtook him, and Jock managed
to give Bothwell three vicious thrusts of his
skene dhu&mdash;"Wha daur meddle wi' me!"&mdash;before
Bothwell's whinger drove death into little
Jock Elliott.</p>

<p>Bothwell, wounded, perhaps to death, so word
went up to Edinburgh, was carried to the
Hermitage.</p>

<p>Buchanan, the scandalous chronicler of the
time&mdash;there were such in Scotland, then, and
always for Mary&mdash;set down that "when news
thereof was brought to Borthwick to the Queen,
she flingeth away in haste like a madwoman by
great journeys in post, in the sharp time of winter,
first to Melrose, and then to Jedworth."</p>

<p>It happened to be the crisp, lovely, truly Scottish
time, October, and Mary opened court at
Jedburgh October 9, presiding at the meetings
of the Privy Council, and then rode to the Hermitage
October 16. She rode with an escort
which included the Earl of Moray, the Earl
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
of Huntley, Mr. Secretary Lethington, and more
men of less note. For six days the girl queen
(Mary was only twenty-four in this year of the
birth of James, year before the death of Darnley,
the marriage with Bothwell, the imprisonment
at Loch Leven) had been mewed to state
affairs, and a ride through the brown October
woods, thirty miles there and thirty miles back
again, must have lured the queen who was always
keen for adventure, whether Bothwell was
the goal, or just adventure.</p>

<p>The mist of the morning turned to thick rain
by night, and the return ride was made in increasing
wet and darkness. Once, riding ahead
and alone and rapidly, the Queen strayed from
the trail, was bogged in a mire, known to-day as
the Queen's Mire, and rescued with difficulty.</p>

<p>Next day Mary lay sick at Jedburgh, a sickness
of thirty days, nigh unto death. News was
sent to Edinburgh, and bells were rung, and
prayers offered in St. Giles. On the ninth day
she lay unconscious, in this little town of Jedburgh,
apparently dead, twenty years before
Fotheringay. "Would God I had died at Jedburgh."</p>

<p>She did not die. Darnley visited her one day,
coming from Glasgow. Bothwell came as soon
as he could be moved, and the two made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
convalescence together in this old house of
Jedburgh, perhaps the happiest house of all
those where the legend of Mary persists. Even
to-day it has its charm. The windowed turret
looks out on the large fruit garden that stretches
down to the Jed, very like that very little turret
of "Queen Mary's Lookout" at Roscoff
where the child queen had landed in France less
than twenty years before.</p>

<p>Five years later, when Mary was in an English
prison, a proclamation was read in her
name at the town cross of Jedburgh, the herald
was roughly handled by the Provost who received
his orders from England, and Buccleuch
and Ker of Fernihurst revenged themselves by
hanging ten loyal (?) citizens who stood with
the Provost.</p>

<p>Later, a century later, when at the town cross
the magistrates were drinking a health to the
new sovereign, a well-known Jacobite came by.
They insisted on his joining in the toast. And
he pledged&mdash;"confusion to King William, and
the restitution of our sovereign and the heir!"
Bravo, the Borderers!</p>

<h4><i>Selkirk</i></h4>

<p>The sentimental journeymen&mdash;with whom I
count myself openly&mdash;may hesitate to visit Yarrow.
It lies so near the Melrose country, and is
so much a part of that, in song and story, that
it would seem like leaving out the fragrance of
the region to omit Yarrow. And yet&mdash;. One
has read "Yarrow Unvisited," one of the loveliest
of Wordsworth's poems. And one has
read "Yarrow Visited." And the conclusion
is too easy that if the unvisitings and visitings
differ as much as the poems it surely were better
not to "turn aside to Yarrow," to accept
it as</p>

<p class="poem">
"Enough if in our hearts we know<br />
There's such a place as Yarrow....<br />
For when we're there although 'tis fair,<br />
'Twill be another Yarrow."<br />
</p>

<p>There is peril at times in making a dream
come true, in translating the dream into reality,
in lifting the mists from the horizon of imagination.
Should one hear an English skylark, an
Italian nightingale? should one see Carcassonne,
should one visit Yarrow?</p>

<p>Ah, welladay. I have heard, I have seen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
Just at first, because no dream can ever quite
come true, not the dream of man in stone, or
of song in bird-throat, or even of nature in
trees and sky and hills, there is a disappointment.
But after the reality these all slip away
into the misty half-remembered things, even
Carcassonne, even Yarrow; the dream enriched
by the vision, the vision softened again into
dream.</p>

<p>And so, I will down into Yarrow.</p>

<p>Coaches run, or did before the war, and will
after the war, through the pleasant dales of
Yarrow and Moffat, dales which knew battles
long ago and old unhappy far off things, but
very silent now, too silent; almost one longs for
a burst of Border warfare that the quiet may
be filled with fitting clamour. The coaches meet
at Tibbie Shiel's on St. Mary's and it is to
Tibbie's that you are bound, as were so many
gallant gentlemen, especially literary gentlemen,
before you.</p>

<p>Selkirk is the starting point. And Selkirk is
a very seemly, very prosperous town, looking
not at all like an ecclesiastic city, as it started
to be in the dear dead days of David the saint,
looking very much as a hill city in Italy will
look some day when Italy becomes entirely "redeemed"
and modern, and exists for itself in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>stead
of for the tourist. Selkirk is indifferent
to tourists, as indeed is every Scottish town;
Scotland and Scotsmen are capable of existing
for themselves. Selkirk hangs against the hillside
above the Ettrick, and its show places are
few; the spot where Montrose lodged the night
before the defeat at Philipshaugh, the statue of
Scott when he was sheriff, "shirra," the statue
of Mungo Park near where he was given his
medical training, and the home of Andrew
Lang.</p>

<p>There is no trace of the "kirk o' the shielings,"
founded by the religious from Iona, from
which by way of Scheleschyrche came Selkirk.
Nor is there trace of Davis's pile, ruined or unruined,
in this near, modern, whirring city. It
is the sound of the looms one remembers in Selkirk,
making that infinity of yards of Scotch
tweed to clothe the world. Selkirk and Galashiels
and Hawick form the Glasgow of the
Border.</p>

<p>Always industrious, in the time of Flodden
it was the "souters of Selkirk" who marched
away to the Killing&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"Up wi' the Souters of Selkirk<br />
And down wi' the Earl o' Home."<br />
</p>

<p>These same souters&mdash;shoemakers&mdash;were busy
in the time of Prince Charles Edward and con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>tracted
to furnish two thousand pair of shoes
to his army; but one does not inquire too closely
into whether they furnished any quota of the
four thousand feet to go therein.</p>

<p>It was a warm sunny day when I made my
pilgrimage up the Yarrow to St. Mary's. Although
Yarrow has always sung in my ears, I
think it was rather to see one sight that I came
for the first time to Scotland, to see</p>

<p class="poem">
"The swan on still St. Mary's Lake<br />
Float double, swan and shadow."<br />
</p>

<p>I rather think it was for this I had journeyed
across the Atlantic and up the East coast route.
Such a sentimental lure would I follow. But
then, if that seems wasteful and ridiculous excess
of sentiment, let us be canny enough, Scotch
enough, to admit that one sees so many other
things, incidentally.</p>

<p>The "wan waters" of the Yarrow were shimmering,
glimmering, in the morning light as I
coached out of Selkirk, and by Carterhaugh.</p>

<p class="poem">
"I forbid ye, maidens a',<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That wear gowd in your hair,</span><br />
To come or gae by Carterhaugh;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For young Tamlane is there."</span><br />
</p>

<p>These round-shouldered hills, once covered
with the Wood of Caledon, and the Forest of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
Ettrick, and the Forest of Yarrow, are very
clear and clean in their green lawns to-day,
scarce an ancient tree or a late descendant
standing; here and there only gnarled and deformed,
out of the centuries, out of perhaps
that "derke forest" of James IV. His son, the
Fifth James, thought to subdue the Border and
increase his revenue by placing thousands of
sheep in this forest; and these ruining the trees
have decreased the tourists' rightful revenue.
It is because of this absence of trees that one
is perhaps more conscious of the shining ribbon
of river; longer, clearer stretches may be seen
in the green plain:</p>

<p class="poem">
"And is this&mdash;Yarrow? This the stream<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of which my fancy cherished</span><br />
So faithfully a waking dream?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">An image that has perished!</span><br />
O that some minstrel's harp were near<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To utter notes of gladness,</span><br />
And chase this silence from the air<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That fills my heart with sadness!"</span><br />
</p>

<p>About Philipshaugh, two miles from Selkirk,
the trees are in something of large estate, with
oak and birch and fir and rowan, making dark
shadows in the fair morning, as the historically
minded traveler would fain have it. For it was
there that Montrose met defeat, his small band
against Leslie's many men. All about there lie<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
legends of his fight and his flight across the
Minchmoor and on to the North.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i112.jpg" width="600" height="352" alt="NEWARK CASTLE." title="" />
<span class="caption">NEWARK CASTLE.</span>
</div>

<p>And through here Scott loved to wander.
Here he let the Minstrel begin his Last Lay&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"He paused where Newark's stately Tower<br />
Looks down from Yarrow's birchen bower."<br />
</p>

<p>And it was hither the Scotch poet came with
Wordsworth, as the English poet describes it&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"Once more by Newark's Castle gate<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Long left without a warder,</span><br />
I stood, looked, listened, and with Thee<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Great Minstrel of the Border."</span><br />
</p>

<p>Nearby, and near the highways, is the deserted
farm cottage, the birthplace of Mungo
Park, who traveled about the world even as you
and I, and I fancy his thought must often have
returned to the Yarrow.</p>

<p>The driver will point out the Trench of Wallace,
a redout a thousand feet long, on the
height to the North; and here will come into the
Border memories of another defender of Scotland
who seems rather to belong to the North
and West.</p>

<p>Soon we reach the Kirk of Yarrow, a very
austere "reformed" looking basilica, dating
back to 1640, which was a reformed date, set
among pleasant gardens and thick verdure. Scott
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
and Wordsworth and Hogg have worshiped
here, and from its ceiling the heraldic
devices of many Borderers speak a varied
history.</p>

<p>Crossing the bridge we are swiftly, unbelievingly,
on the Dowie Dens of Yarrow.</p>

<p class="poem">
"Yestreen I dream'd a dolefu' dream;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I fear there will be sorrow!</span><br />
I dream'd I pu'd the heather green,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wi' my true love on Yarrow.</span><br />
<br />
"But in the glen strive armed men;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They've wrought me dole and sorrow;</span><br />
They've slain&mdash;the comeliest knight they've slain&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He bleeding lies on Yarrow.</span><br />
<br />
"She kiss'd his cheek, she kaim'd his hair,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She search'd his wounds all thorough;</span><br />
She kiss'd them till her lips grew red,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On the dowie houms of Yarrow."</span><br />
</p>

<p>Then we come into the country of Joseph
Hogg. The farm where he was tenant and
failed, for Hogg was a shepherd and a poet,
which means a wanderer and a dreamer. And
soon to the Gordon Arms, a plain rambling cement
structure, where Hogg and Scott met by
appointment and took their last walk together.</p>

<p>Hogg is the spirit of all the Ettrick place.
Can you not hear his skylark&mdash;"Bird of the
wilderness, blithesome and cumberless"&mdash;in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
that far blue sky above Altrive, where he died&mdash;"Oh,
to abide in the desert with thee!"</p>

<p>And now the driver tells us we are at the
Douglass Glen, up there to the right lies the
shattered keep of the good Lord James Douglass,
the friend of Bruce. Here fell the
"Douglass Tragedy," and the bridle path from
Yarrow to Tweed is still to be traced.</p>

<p class="poem">
"O they rade on and on they rade,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And a' by the light of the moon,</span><br />
Until they came to yon wan water,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And there they lighted down."</span><br />
</p>


<h4><i>St. Mary's</i></h4>

<p>And soon we are at St. Mary's Loch&mdash;which
we have come to see. To one who comes from
a land of lakes, from the Land of the Sky Blue
Water, there must be at first a sudden rush of
disappointment. This is merely a lake, merely
a stretch of water. The hills about are all
barren, rising clear and round against the sky.
They fold and infold as though they would
shield the lake bereft of trees, as though they
would shut out the world. Here and there, but
very infrequent, is a cluster of trees; for the
most part it is water and sky and green heathery
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
hills. The water is long and narrow, a small
lake as our American lakes go, three miles by
one mile; but large as it looms in romance, rich
as it bulks in poetry.</p>

<span class="caption">INTERIOR VIEW, TIBBIE SHIEL&#39;S INN.</span>
</div>

<p>Tibbie Shiel's is, of course, our goal. One
says Tibbie Shiel's, as one says Ritz-Carlton,
or the William the Conqueror at Dives. For
this is the most celebrated inn in all Scotland,
and it must be placed with the celebrated inns
of the world. There is no countryside better
sung than this which lies about St. Mary's, and
no inn, certainly not anywhere a country inn,
where more famous men have foregathered to
be themselves. Perhaps the place has changed
since the most famous, the little famed days,
when Scott stopped here after a day's hunting,
deer or Border song and story, up Meggatdale;
and those famous nights of Christopher North
and the Ettrick shepherd, nights deserving to
be as famous as the Arabian or Parisian or
London. The world has found it out, and times
have changed, as a local poet complains&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"Sin a' the world maun gang<br />
And picnic at St. Mary's."<br />
</p>

<p>The inn, a rambling white house, stands on
a strip between two waters, added to no doubt
since Tibbie first opened its doors, but the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
closed beds are still there&mdash;it was curious
enough to see them the very summer that the
Graham Moffatts played "Bunty" and "The
Closed Bed"&mdash;and the brasses which Tibbie
polished with such housewifely care.</p>

<p>For Tibbie was a maid in the household of
the Ettrick shepherd's mother. She married,
she had children, she came here to live. Then
her husband died, and quite accidentally Tibbie
became hostess to travelers, nearly a hundred
years ago. For fifty-four years Tibbie herself
ran this inn; she died in what is so short a time
gone, as Scottish history goes, in 1878.</p>

<p>During that time hosts of travelers, particularly,
wandered through the Border, came to
this "wren's nest" as North called it. Hogg,
of course, was most familiar, and here he wished
to have a "bit monument to his memory in some
quiet spot forninst Tibbie's dwelling." He sits
there, in free stone, somewhat heavily, a shepherd's
staff in his right hand, and in his left
a scroll carrying the last line from the "Queen's
Wake"&mdash;"Hath tayen the wandering winds to
sing."</p>

<p>Edward Irving, walking from Kirkcaldy to
Annan, was here the first year after Tibbie
opened her doors so shyly. Carlyle, walking
from Ecclefechan to Edinburgh, in his student<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
days, caught his first glimpse of Yarrow from
here&mdash;and slept, may it be, in one of these closed
beds? Gladstone was here in the early '40's
during a Midlothian campaign. Dr. John
Brown&mdash;"Rab"&mdash;came later, and even R. L. S.
knew the hospitality of Tibbie Shiel's when
Tibbie was still hostess.</p>

<p>It is a long list and a brave one. In this very
dining-room they ate simply and abundantly,
after the day's work; in this "parlour" they
continued their talk. And surely St. Mary's
Lake was the same.</p>

<p>Down on the shore there stands a group of
trees, not fir trees, though these are most native
here. And here we loafed the afternoon away&mdash;for
fortunately we were the only ones who
"picnic at St. Mary's." There were the gentleman
and his wife whom we took for journalistic
folk, they were so worldly and so intelligent
and discussed the world and the possibilities
of world-war&mdash;that was several years
ago&mdash;until at the Kirk of Yarrow the local minister,
Dr. Borlund, uncovered this minister,
James Thomson, from Paisley. If all the
clergy of Scotland should become as these, austerity
of reform would go and the glow of culture
would come.</p>

<p>We all knew our history and our poetry of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
this region, but none so well as the minister.
It was he who recited from Marmion that description
which is still so accurate&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"By lone St. Mary's silent Lake;<br />
Thou know'st it well&mdash;nor fen nor sedge<br />
Pollute the clear lake's crystal edge;<br />
Abrupt and sheer the mountains sink<br />
At once upon the level brink;<br />
And just a trace of silver strand<br />
Marks where the water meets the land.<br />
Far in the mirror, bright and blue,<br />
Each hill's huge outline you may view;<br />
Shaggy with heath, but lonely, bare,<br />
Nor tree nor bush nor brake is there,<br />
Save where of land, yon silver line<br />
Bears thwart the lake the scatter'd pine.<br />
Yet even this nakedness has power,<br />
And aids the feelings of the hour;<br />
Nor thicket, dell nor copse you spy,<br />
Where living thing conceal'd might lie;<br />
Not point, retiring, hides a dell<br />
Where swain, or woodman lone might dwell;<br />
There's nothing left to fancy's guess,<br />
You see that all is loneliness;<br />
And silence aids&mdash;though the steep hills<br />
Send to the lake a thousand rills;<br />
In summer time, so soft they weep.<br />
The sound but lulls the ear asleep;<br />
Your horse's hoof-tread sounds too rude,<br />
So stilly is the solitude."<br />

<p>Across the water is the old graveyard of vanished
St. Mary's kirk. And it was the

low-voiced minister's wife&mdash;a Babbie a little removed&mdash;who
knew</p>

<p class="poem">
"What boon to lie, as now I lie,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And see in silver at my feet</span><br />
St. Mary's Lake, as if the sky<br />
Had fallen 'tween those hills so sweet,<br />
And this old churchyard on the hill,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That keeps the green graves of the dead,</span><br />
So calm and sweet, so lone and wild still,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And but the blue sky overhead."</span><br />
</p>

<p>We sat in the silences, the still silent afternoon,
conscious of the folk verse that goes&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"St. Mary's Loch lies shimmering still,<br />
But St. Mary's kirkbell's lang dune ringing."<br />
</p>

<p>Suddenly, over the far rim of the water, my
eye caught something white, and then another,
and another. And I knew well that were I but
nearer, as imagination knew was unnecessary,
I might see the swan on still St. Mary's Lake,
and their shadow breaking in the water.</p>

<p class="dropcap"> suppose the Scotsman who has been
born in Edinburgh may have a pardonable
reluctance in praising the town, may
hesitate in appraising it; Stevenson did; Scott
did not. And I suppose if one cannot trace his
ancestry back to Edinburgh, or nearly there,
but must choose some of the other capitals of
the world as his ancestral city, one might begrudge
estate to Edinburgh.</p>

<p>I have none of these hesitations, am hampered
by none of these half and half ways. Being
an American, with half a dozen European
capitals to choose from if I must, and having
been born in an American capital which is
among the loveliest&mdash;I think the loveliest&mdash;I
dare choose Edinburgh as my dream city. I
dare fling away my other capital claims, and
all modification, ever Scotch moderation, to declare
without an "I think" or "they say," Edinburgh
is the most beautiful, the most romantic,
the singular city of the world.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>Those who come out of many generations of
migration grow accustomed to choosing their
quarter of the world; they have come from many
countries and through nomadic ancestors for
a century, or two, or three. And perhaps they,
themselves, have migrated from one state to
another, one city to another. Every American
has had these phases, has suffered the sea
change and the land. Surely then he may adopt
his ancestral capital, as correctly as he adopts
his present political capital.</p>

<p>It shall be Edinburgh. And while Constantinople
and Rio and Yokohama may be splendid
for situation, they have always something of
foreign about them, they can never seem to
touch our own proper romance, to have been
the setting for our play. Edinburgh is as
lovely, and then, the chalice of romance has been
lifted for centuries on the high altar of her
situation.</p>

<p>Edinburgh is a small city, as modern cities
go; but I presume it has many thousands of
population, hundreds of thousands. If it were
Glasgow numbers would be important, fixative.
But Edinburgh has had such a population
through the centuries that to cast its total with
only that of the souls now living within her
precincts were to leave out of the picture those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
shadowy and yet brilliant, ever present generations,
who seem all to jostle each other on her
High street, without respect to generations, if
there is very decided respect of simple toward
gentle.</p>

<p>Edinburgh is, curiously, significantly, divided
and scarce united, into Old Town and
New Town. And yet, the Old Town with its
ancient <i>lands</i> so marvelously like modern tenements,
and its poverty which is of no date and
therefore no responsibility of ours, is neither
dead nor deserted, and is still fully one-half
the town. While New Town, looking ever up
to the old, looking across the stretch to Leith,
and to the sea whence came so much threatening
in the old days, and with its memories of
Hume and Scott who are ancient, and of Stevenson,
who, in spite of his immortal youth, does
begin to belong to another generation than ours&mdash;New
Town also, to a new American, is something
old. It has all become Edinburgh, two
perfect halves of a whole which is not less perfect
for the imperfect uniting.</p>

<p>There is no city which can be so "observed."
I venture that when you have stood on Castle
Hill&mdash;on the High Street with its narrow opening
between the <i>lands</i> framing near and far
pictures&mdash;on Calton Hill&mdash;when you have been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
able to "rest and be thankful" at Corstorphine
Hill&mdash;when you have climbed the Salisbury
crags&mdash;when you have mounted to Arthur's
Seat and looked down as did King Arthur before
there was an Edinburgh&mdash;you will believe
that not any slightest corner but fills the eye
and soul.</p>

<p>There is, of course, no single object in Edinburgh
to compare with objects of traveler's interest
farther south. The castle is not the
Tower, Holyrood is a memory beside Windsor,
St. Giles is no Canterbury, St. Mary's is not St.
Paul's, the Royal Scottish art gallery is meager
indeed, notwithstanding certain rare riches in
comparison with the National. But still one
may believe of any of these superior objects, as
T. Sandys retorted to Shovel when they had
played the game of matching the splendours of
Thrums with those of London and Shovel had
named Saint Paul's, and Tommy's list of native
wonders was exhausted, but never Tommy&mdash;"it
would like to be in Thrums!" All these
lesser glories go to make up the singular glory
which is Edinburgh.</p>

<h4><i>The Castle</i></h4>

<p>And there is the castle. Nowhere in all the
world is castle more strategically set to guard
the city and to guard the memories of the city
and the beauty.</p>

<p>For the castle is Edinburgh. It stood there,
stalwart in the plain, thousands and thousands
of years ago, this castle hill which invited a
castle as soon as man began to fortify himself.
It has stood here a thousand years as the bulwark
of man against man. Certain it will stand
there a thousand years to come. And after&mdash;after
man has destroyed and been destroyed, or
when he determines that like night and the sea
there shall be no more destruction. Castle Hill
is immortal.</p>

<p>Always it has been the resort of kings and
princes. First it was the keep of princesses,
far back in Pictish days before Christian time,
this "Castell of the Maydens." From 987 <span class="smcap">B. C.</span>
down to 1566, when Mary was lodged here for
safe keeping in order that James might be born
safe and royal, the castle has had royalties in
its keeping. It has kept them rather badly in
truth. While many kings have been born here,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
few kings have died in its security; almost all
Scottish kings have died tragically, almost all
Scottish kings have died young, and left their
kingdom to some small prince whose regents
held him in this castle for personal security,
while they governed the realm, always to its
disaster.</p>

<p>There is not one of the Stewart kings, one of
the Jameses, from First to Sixth, who did not
come into the heritage of the kingdom as a baby,
a youth; even the Fourth, who rebelled against
his father and won the kingdom&mdash;and wore a
chain around his body secretly for penance.
And these baby kings and stripling princes
have been lodged in the castle for safe keeping,
prologues to the swelling act of the imperial
theme.</p>

<p>History which attempts to be exact begins
the castle in the seventh century, when Edwin
of Deira fortified the place and called it Edwin's
burgh. It was held by Malcolm Canmore,
of whom and of his Saxon queen Margaret,
Dunfermline tells a fuller story; held
against rebels and against English, until Malcolm
fell at Alnwick, and Margaret, dead at
hearing the news, was carried secretly out of
the castle by her devoted and kingly sons.</p>

<p>After Edward I took the castle, for half a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
century it was variously held by the English
as a Border fortress. Once Bruce retook it, a
stealthy night assault, up the cliffs of the west,
and The Bruce razed it. Rebuilt by the Third
Edward, it was taken from this king by a clever
ruse planned by the Douglass, Black Knight of
Liddesdale. A shipload of wine and biscuits
came into harbour, and the unsuspecting castellan,
glad to get such precious food in the far
north, purchased it all and granted delivery
at dawn next morning. The first cart load upset
under the portcullis, the gate could not
be closed, the cry "A Douglass," was raised,
and the castle entered into Scottish keeping,
never to be "English" again until the Act of
Union.</p>

<p>Henry IV and Richard II attempted it, but
failed. Richard III entered it as friend. For
three years it was held for Mary by Kirkcaldy,
while the city was disloyal. Charles I held it
longer than he held England, and Cromwell
claimed it in person as part of the Protectorate.
Prince Charles, the Third, could not take it,
contented himself with the less castellated, more
palatial joys, of Holyrood; a preference he
shared with his greatest grandmother.</p>

<p>To-day perhaps its defense might be battered
down, as some one has suggested, "from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
the Firth by a Japanese cruiser." But it looks
like a Gibraltar, and it keeps impregnably the
treasures of the past; as necessary a defense,
I take it, as of any material treasure of the
present.</p>

<p>If you are a king you must wait to enter; summons
must be made to the Warder, and it must
be certain you are the king; even Edward VII,
most Stewart of recent kings had to prove himself
not Edward I, not English, but "Union."
If you are a commoner you know no such difficulties.</p>

<p>First you linger on the broad Esplanade
where a regiment in kilts is drilling, perhaps
the Black Watch, the Scots Greys. No doubt
of late it has been tramped by regiments of the
"First Hundred Thousand" and later, in training
for the wars.</p>

<p>As an American you linger here in longer
memory. For when Charles was king&mdash;the
phrase sounds recent to one who is eternally
Jacobite&mdash;this level space was a part of Nova
Scotia, and the Scotsmen who were made nobles
with estates in New Scotland were enfeoffed on
this very ground. So close were the relations
between old and new, so indifferent were the
men of adventuring times toward space.</p>

<p>Or, you linger here to recall when Cromwell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
was burned in effigy, along with "his friend the
Devil."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i138.jpg" width="600" height="375" alt="MONS MEG." title="" />
<span class="caption">MONS MEG.</span>
</div>

<p>You pass through the gate, where no wine
casks block the descent of the portcullis, and
the castle is entered. There are three or four
points of particular interest.</p>

<p>Queen Margaret's chapel, the oldest and
smallest religious house in Scotland, a tiny place
indeed, where Margaret was praying when word
was brought of the death of Malcolm in battle,
and she, loyal and royal soul, died the very
night while the enemies from the Highlands,
like an army of Macbeth's, surrounded the
castle. The place is quite authentic, Saxon in
character with Norman touches. I know no
place where a thousand years can be so swept
away, and Saxon Margaret herself seems to
kneel in the perpetual dim twilight before the
chancel.</p>

<p>There is Mons Meg, a monstrous gun indeed,
pointing its mouth toward the Forth, as though
it were the guardian of Scotland. A very pretentious
gun, which was forged for James II,
traveled to the sieges of Dumbarton and of Norham,
lifted voice in salute to Mary in France on
her marriage to the Dauphin, was captured by
Cromwell and listed as "the great iron murderer,
Muckle Meg," and "split its throat" in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
saluting the Duke of York in 1682, a most
Jacobite act of loyalty. After the Rising of
the Forty Five this gun was taken to London,
as though to take it from Scotland were to take
the defense from Jacobitism. But Sir Walter
Scott, restoring Scotland, and being in much
favour with George IV, secured the return of
Mons Meg. It was as though a prince of the
realm has returned. Now, the great gun, large
enough to shoot men for ammunition, looks,
silently but sinisterly, out over the North Sea.</p>

<p>History comes crowding its events in memory
when one enters Old Parliament Hall. It is
fitly ancestral, a noble hall with an open timbered
roof of great dignity, with a collection
of armour and equipment that particularly re-equips
the past. And in this hall, under this
roof, what splendour, what crime! Most criminal,
the "black dinner" given to the Black
Douglasses to their death. Unless one should
resent the dinner given by Leslie to Cromwell,
when there was no black bull's head
served.</p>

<p>By a secret stair, which commoners and Jacobites
may use to-day, communication was had
with the Royal Lodgings, and often must Queen
Mary have gone up and down those stairs,
carrying the tumult of her heart, the perplexity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
of her kingdom; for Mary was both woman and
sovereign.</p>

<p>The Royal Lodgings contain Queen Mary's
Rooms, chiefly; the other rooms are negligible.
It is a tiny bedchamber, too small to house the
eager soul of Mary, but very well spaced for
the niggard soul of James. One merely accepts
historically the presence of Mary here;
there is too much intertwining of "H" and
"M." No Jacobite but divorces Darnley from
Mary, even though he would not effect divorce
with gunpowder. King James I, when he returned
fourteen years after to the place where
he was VI, made a pilgrimage to his own birth-room
on June 19, 1617. I suppose he found the
narrow space like unto the Majesty that doth
hedge a king.</p>

<p>Mary must have beat her heart against these
walls as an eagle beats wings against his cage.
She never loved the place. Who could love it
who must live in it? It was royally hung;
she made it fit for living, with carpets from
Turkey, chairs and tables from France, gold
hangings that were truly gold for the bed, and
many tapestries with which to shut out the
cold&mdash;eight pictures of the Judgment of Paris;
four pictures of the Triumph of Virtue!</p>

<p>Here she kept her library, one hundred and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
fifty-three precious volumes&mdash;where are they
now? "The Queen readeth daily after her dinner,"
wrote Randolph, English envoy, to his
queen, "instructed by a learned man, Mr.
George Buchanan, somewhat of Lyvie."</p>

<p>And I wondered if here she wrote that
Prayer which but the other day I came upon in
the bookshop of James Thin, copied into a book
of a hundred years back, in a handwriting that
has something of Queen Mary's quality in it&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"O Domine Deus!<br />
Speravi in te;<br />
O care mi Iesu!<br />
Nunc libera me:<br />
In dura catena,<br />
In misera poena<br />
Desidero te;<br />
Languendo, gemendo,<br />
Et genuflectendo<br />
Adoro, imploro,<br />
Ut liberes me!"<br />
</p>

<p>Her windows looked down across the city
toward Holyrood. Almost she must have heard
John Knox thunder in the pulpit of St. Giles,
and thunder against her. And, directly beneath
far down she saw the Grassmarket.
Sometimes it flashed with gay tournament folk;
for before and during Mary's time all the world
came to measure lances in Edinburgh. Some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>times
it swarmed with folk come to watch an
execution; in the next century it was filled in the
"Killing Time," with Covenanter mob applauding
the execution of Royalists, with Royalist
mob applauding the execution of Covenanters;
Mary's time was not the one "to glorify God in
the Grassmarket."</p>

<p>At the top of the market, near where the West
Bow leads up to the castle, was the house of
Claverhouse, who watched the killings. At the
bottom of the market was the West Port
through which Bonnie Dundee rode away.</p>

<p class="poem">
"To the Lords of Convention, 'twas Claverhouse spoke,<br />
Ere the king's crown go down there are crowns to be broke,<br />
So each cavalier who loves honour and me,<br />
Let him follow the bonnet of Bonnie Dundee.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Come fill up my cup, come fill up my can,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Come saddle my horses and call up my men,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fling all your gates open, and let me gae free,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For 'tis up with the bonnets of Bonnie Dundee."</span><br />
</p>

<p>And to-day, but especially on Saturday
nights, if you care to take your life, or your
peace in hand, you can join a strange and rather
awful multitude as it swarms through the Grassmarket,
more and more drunken as midnight
comes on, and not less or more drunken than
the mob which hanged Captain Porteous.</p>

<p>It is a decided relief to look down and find<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
the White Hart Inn, still an inn, where Dorothy
and William Wordsworth lodged, on Thursday
night, September 15, 1803&mdash;"It was not
noisy, and tolerably cheap. Drank tea, and
walked up to the Castle."</p>

<p>The Cowgate was a fashionable suburb in
Mary's time. A canon of St. Andrews wrote
in 1530, "nothing is humble or lowly, everything
magnificent." On a certain golden gray afternoon
I had climbed to Arthur's Seat to see the
city through the veil of mist&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"I saw rain falling and the rainbow drawn<br />
On Lammermuir. Harkening I heard again<br />
In my precipitous city beaten bells<br />
Winnow the keen sea wind."<br />
</p>

<p>It was late, gathering dusk and rain, when
I reached the level and thinking to make a short
cut&mdash;this was once the short cut to St. Cuthbert's
from Holyrood&mdash;I ventured into the Cowgate,
and wondered at my own temerity. Stevenson
reports, "One night I went along the
Cowgate after every one was a-bed but the policeman."
Well, if Scott liked to "put a
cocked hat on a story," Stevenson liked to put
it on his own adventures. The Cowgate, in
dusk rain, is adventure enough.</p>

<p>Across the height lies Greyfriar's. The
church is negligible, the view from there superb,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
the place historic. One year after Jenny Geddes
threw her stool in St. Giles and started
the Reformation&mdash;doesn't it sound like Mrs.
O'Leary's cow?&mdash;the Covenant was signed
(Feb. 28, 1638) on top of a tomb still shown,
hundreds pressing to the signing, some signing
with their blood. The Reformation was on, not
to be stopped until all Scotland was harried and
remade.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<span class="caption">GREYFRIARS&#39; CHURCHYARD.</span>
</div>

<p>I like best to think that in this churchyard,
on a rainy Sunday, Scott met a charming girl,
fell in love with her, took her home under his
umbrella, and, did not marry her&mdash;his own romance!</p>

<p>Because no king shall ever wear the crown
again, nor wave the scepter, nor wield the sword
of state, the Regalia, housed in the Crown
Room, and guarded from commoner and king
by massive iron grating, is more interesting
than any other appanage of royalty in the
world. The crown which was worn by Bruce,
and which sat rather uneasily on the very unsteady
head of Charles II at what time he was
crowned at Scone and was scolded, is of pure
gold and much bejeweled. The scepter, made in
Paris for James V, carries a beryl, come from
Egypt three thousand years ago, or, from a
Druid priest in the mist of time. The sword
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
was a gift from Pope Julius to James IV; in
those days the Scottish sovereign was surely
the "Most Catholic Majesty."</p>

<p>England has no ancient regalia; hers were
thrown into the melting pot by Cromwell. The
Protector&mdash;and Destructor&mdash;would fain have
grasped these "Honours," but they were spirited
away, and later concealed in the castle.
Here they remained a hundred and ten years,
sealed in a great oak chest. The rumour increased
that they had gone to England. And
finally Sir Walter Scott secured an order from
George IV to open the chest (Feb. 4, 1818).</p>

<p>It was a tremendous moment to Scott. Could
he restore the Honours as well as the country?
There they lay, crown of The Bruce, scepter of
James V, sword of Pope and King. The castle
guns thundered&mdash;how Mons Meg must have
regretted her lost voice!</p>

<p>And still we can hear the voice of Scott, when
a commissioner playfully lifted the crown as if
to place it on the head of a young lady near&mdash;"No,
by God, no!" Never again shall this
crown rest on any head. That is assured in a
codicil to the Act of Union. And&mdash;it may be
that other crowns shall in like manner gain a
significance when they no longer rest on uneasy
heads.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>The view from the King's bastion is royal.
Where is there its superior? And only its rival
from Calton Hill, from Arthur's Seat. The
Gardens lie below, the New Town spreads out,
the city runs down to Leith, the Firth shines
and carries on its bosom the Inchkeith and the
May; the hills of Fife rampart the North; the
Highlands with Ben Lomond for sentinel form
the purple West; and south are the Braid hills
and the heathery Pentlands&mdash;the guide has
pointed through a gap in the castle wall to the
hills and to the cottage at Swanston.</p>

<p class="poem">
"City of mists and rain and blown gray spaces,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dashed with the wild wet colour and gleam of tears,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nay, for the City is throned in Eternity!</span><br />
Hark! from the soaring castle a cannon's thunder<br />

</p>


<h4><i>High Street</i></h4>

<p>If the Baedeker with a cautious reservation,
declares Princes Street "Perhaps" the handsomest
in Europe, there is no reservation in the
guide-book report of Taylor, the "Water Poet,"
who wrote of the High Street in the early Sixteen
Hundreds, "the fairest and goodliest
streete that ever my eyes beheld." Surely it
was then the most impressive street in the
world. Who can escape a sharp impression
to-day? It was then the most curious street
in the world, and it has lost none of its power
to evoke wonder.</p>

<p>A causeway between the castle and Holyrood,
a steep ridge lying between the Nor' Loch
(where now are the Princes' Gardens) and the
Sou' Loch (where now are the Meadows, suburban
dwelling) the old height offered the first
refuge to those who would fain live under the
shadow of the castle. As the castle became<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
more and more the center of the kingdom, dwelling
under its shadow became more and more important,
if not secure. The mightiest lords of
the kingdom built themselves town houses along
the causeway. French influence was always
strong, and particularly in architecture. So
these tall <i>lands</i> rose on either side of the long
street, their high, many-storied fronts on the
High Street, their many more storied backs toward
the Lochs. They were, in truth, part of
the defense of the town; from their tall stories
the enemy, especially the "auld enemy," could
be espied almost as soon as from the castle.
And the closes, the wynds, those dark tortuous
alleys which lead between, and which to-day in
their squalor are the most picturesque corners
of all Europe, were in themselves means of defense
in the old days when cannon were as often
of leather as of iron, and guns were new and
were little more reaching than arrows, and
bludgeons and skene dhus and fists were the
final effective weapon when assault was intended
to the city.</p>

<p>The ridge divides itself into the Lawnmarket,
the High Street, and the Canongate; St. Giles
uniting the first two, and the Netherbow port,
now removed, dividing the last two.</p>

<p>The Lawnmarket in the old days was near-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>royal,
and within its houses the great nobles
lodged, and royalty was often a guest, or a
secret guest. The High Street was the business
street, centering the life of the city, its
trade, its feuds&mdash;"a la mani&eacute;re d'Edimborg"
ran the continental saying of fights&mdash;its religion,
its executions, its burials. The Canongate,
outside the city proper and outside the
Flodden wall and within the precincts of Holyrood,
therefore regarded as under the protection
of Holy Church, became the aristocratic
quarters of the later Stewarts, of the wealthy
nobles of the later day.</p>

<p>I suppose one may spend a lifetime in Edinburgh,
with frequent days in the Old Town, wandering
the High Street, with the eye never
wearying, always discovering the new. And I
suppose it would take a lifetime, born in Old
Town and of Old Town, to really know the quarter.
I am not certain I should care to spend a
lifetime here; but I have never and shall never
spend sufficient of this life here. It is unsavoury
of course; it is slattern, it is squalid,
danger lurks in the wynds and drunkenness
spreads itself in the closes. If the old warning
cry of "Gardey loo!" is no longer heard at ten
o' the night, one still has need of the answering
"Haud yer hand!" or, your nose. Dr. Samuel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
Johnson, walking this street on his first night
in Edinburgh, arm in arm with Boswell, declared,
"I can smell you in the dark!" No
sensitive visitor will fail to echo him to-day.
There are drains and sewers, there is modern
sanitation in old Edinburgh. But the habits
of the centuries are not easily overcome; and
the Old Town still smells as though with all the
old aroma of the far years. Still, it is high, it
is wind-swept&mdash;and what of Venice, what of the
Latin Quarter, what of Mile End, what of the
East Side?</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i154.jpg" width="600" height="381" alt="MORAY HOUSE." title="" />
<span class="caption">MORAY HOUSE.</span>
</div>

<p>But there is still splendour and power, bequeathed
as Taylor said, "from antiquitie to
posteritie," in spite of the decline and the decay.
If the palace of Mary of Lorraine on
Castle Hill is fallen and the doorways are in
the Museum&mdash;Mary who was mother to Mary
Queen, and contemporary worthy to Catherine
of Medici&mdash;there are still, at the end of the long
street, Moray House and Queensberry House.
Moray is where Cromwell lodged in 1648, and
gave no hint of what was coming in 1649; if he
had, history might have been different; to-day
Moray House is the United Free Church Training
college! Queensberry House is where lived
those Queensberry marquises of fighting and
sporting renown, and where the Marquis lived
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
who forced through the Act of Union&mdash;"There
ended an old song"; and now it is the Refuge
for the Destitute!</p>

<p>There is still beauty shining through the dust
and the cobwebs; here a doorway with bold insignia
and exquisite carving, leading to&mdash;nowhere;
here a bit of painting, Norrie's perhaps,
or a remnant of timbered ceiling; and everywhere,
now as then&mdash;more now than then, since
sanitary destruction has had its way here and
there&mdash;glimpses of the city and the moors and
the mountains.</p>

<p>It is invidious to compare, to choose from
these closes. Each has its history, its old habitations,
its old associations, its particular picturesqueness;
Lady Stair's, Baxter's, Byer's,
Old Stamp Office, White Horse, and many
more.</p>

<p>Through this street what glory that was Scotland
has not passed and what degradation,
what power has not been displayed and what
abasement? To see it now, filled with people
and with marching troops in honour of the visiting
king, is to get back a little of ancient history,
of greater glory. It lends itself to such
majesty, dull and deserted as it is for the most
part.</p>

<p>When the King came to Edinburgh following<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
on his coronation, making a pilgrimage of his
realm, he came to St. Giles, as has come every
sovereign of Scotland, from Malcolm who may
have worshiped in the Culdee church, to
George in whose honour the chapel of the
Thistle and the Rose was unveiled.</p>

</div>

<p>On a Sunday morning I hurried to St. Giles
to see the trooping of the colours. (Later, listening
to Dr. White, in a recently built reformed
church on Princes Street, I heard a sermon from
the text, "You shall see the king in all his
beauty." But, no mention of King George!
It was even as it was in the old days.)</p>

<p>In truth it was a brave sight to find the High
Street thronged with people, and the regiments
marching down from St. Giles to Holyrood.
The king did not enter town till next day. (I
saw, with some resentment, over the door of a
public house, the motto, "Will ye no come back
again?") But, somehow, so many kings gone
on, the play was rather better staged with the
sovereign not there. I learned then how
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
gorgeous the old days must have been with their
colour and glitter and flash.</p>

<p>I suppose there was a tall <i>land</i> where in my
day stood and still stands Hogg's hotel, just
above the Tron Kirk; the <i>lands</i> on the south
side the High burned a century ago. But, to
the American gazing down on ancient memories
and present sovereignties, there was a wonderful
courtesy shown by the hotel. I had interrupted
their quiet Sabbath; it can still be quiet
in Edinburgh notwithstanding that a tram car
carried me on my way hither. The dining-room
of this hotel looked out on the High, and
it was breakfast time for these covenanting-looking
guests from the countryside. But I,
an invader, was made welcome and given the
best seat on the balcony; a stranger and they
took me in. Sometime I shall take up residence
in this Latin Quarter, and if not in Lady Stair's
Close, then in Hogg's hotel. The name sounds
sweeter if you have just come up from Ettrick.</p>

<p>Nor did I miss the King. For</p>

<p class="poem">
"I saw pale kings, and princes too,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pale warriors, death-pale were they all;</span><br />
Who cry'd&mdash;'La Belle Dame sans merci<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hath thee in thrall!'"</span><br />
</p>

<p>It was the Belle Dame, it was the Queen, I
saw most often on the High Street, riding to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
and fro from the time of the "haar" on her return
from France, till that last terrible night
and the ride to Loch Leven.</p>

<p>After that you may visit the John Knox
house if you will, and read for your edification
its motto. "Lyfe God aboune al and yi nicht-bour
as yi Self," and buy a book or two in its
book shop. I took particular pleasure in buying
a girlish picture of Mary Queen, and a book
of the poems of Robert Fergusson, neither of
which would have pleasured John.</p>

<p>After that you may look at the "I. K." in the
pavement, and realize that Dr. Johnson's wish
for Knox has been fulfilled&mdash;"I hope in the
highway."</p>

<p>After that you may look on the heart stamped
in the pavement near St. Giles, where once
stood the Heart of Midlothian, the Old Tolbooth.</p>

<p>There is only one other memory of High
Street and of Scotland that for me equals that
of Mary. It is Montrose. Up the Canongate
comes the rumbling of a tumbril, like the
French Revolution. And out of the high <i>lands</i>
there look the hundreds of Covenanting folk,
triumphant for the moment. And on the balcony
of Moray House, within which the marriage
of Lady Mary Stewart to the Marquis
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
of Lorne has just been celebrated, there stands
the wedding party, and among them the Earl
of Argyle. Up the street comes the cart. And
within it clad like a bridegroom&mdash;"fyne scarlet
coat to his knee, trimmed with silver galoons,
lined with taffeta, roses in his shoon, and stockings
of incarnet silk"&mdash;stands the Marquis of
Montrose, the loyalest Scotsman that ever
lived.</p>

<p>After the field of Kylsyth, after the field of
Philipshaugh, and the flight to the North and
the betrayal, he has been brought back to Edinburgh,
to a swift and covenanting sentence,
and to death at the Tron.</p>

<p>His eyes meet proudly those of Argyle who
has deserted his king and who thinks to stand
in with the Covenant and with the future. It
is the eyes of Argyle which drop. And Montrose
goes on.</p>

<p>His head is on the picket of the Netherbow
Port. His four quarters are sent to the four
corners of the kingdom, Glasgow, Perth, Aberdeen,
Inverness.</p>

<p>But the end is not yet. The tables turn, as
they turned so often in those unstable times.
It is Argyle who goes to the scaffold. Charles
is king, the Second Charles. There is an edict.
The body of Montrose is dug up out of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
Boroughmoor. It is buried in Holyrood. The
four quarters are reassembled from Glasgow
and Perth and Aberdeen and Inverness. A
procession fairly royal moves from Holyrood
to St. Giles. At the Netherbow it pauses. The
head is taken down from the pike. The body
of Montrose is whole again. An honourable
burial takes place in the cathedral sanctuary.</p>

<p>Even though when search was made at the
restoring of the church and the erection of the
effigy the remains could not be found, there has
been that justification by procession and by
faith, that justification of loyalty that we remember
when we remember Montrose&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"He either fears his fate too much,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or his deserts are small,</span><br />

<h4><i>Holyrood</i></h4>

<p>Holyrood, ruined as it is, empty as it is, spurious
as it is, still can house the Stewarts. Nowhere
else are they so completely and splendidly
Stewart. It is the royalest race which ever
played at being sovereign; in sharp contrast
with the heavier, more successful Tudors;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
crafty but less crafty than the Medici; amorous
but more loyal than the Bourbons.</p>

<p>Never did kings claim sovereignty through a
more divine right&mdash;and only one (whisper sometimes
intimates that he was not Stewart, but
substitute; but he left a Stewart descent) failed
to pay the penalty for such assertion. It was
the splendour which was Stewart while they
lived, the tragedy that was Stewart when they
came to die, which makes them the royal race.</p>

<p>There were born in Holyrood not one of them,
unless it be James V. But almost all of them
were married in Holyrood, held here their festive
days, and, not one of them died in Holyrood.
It is their life, the vivid intense flash of
it, across those times that seem mysterious,
even legendary in remembered times north of
the Border. Life was a holiday to each of the
Stewarts, and he spent it in the palace and in
the pleasance of Holyrood.</p>

<p>The Abbey, with the monastery which was
attached to it, begins far back before the Stewarts.
It was founded by David I, the abbey-builder.
Legend has it that he went a-hunting
on a holy day, and straying from the "noys and
dyn of Bugillis," a white stag came against
him. David thought to defend himself, but a
hand bearing a cross came out of the cloud, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
the stag was exorcised. David kept the cross.
In dream that night within the castle he was
commanded to build an abbey where he had been
saved, and the hunting place being this scant
mile and a quarter from the castle&mdash;then a forest
where now it is treeless&mdash;David placed this
convenient abbey where it has stood for six centuries,
defying fire and war and reformation,
until the citizens of Edinburgh ravaged it when
the roof fell in in the middle of the eighteenth
century.</p>

<p>There is a curious feeling when one crosses
the Girth stones at the lower end of the Canongate.
It is a century and more since this was
sanctuary. But it is impossible to step across
these stones, into the "Liberty of Holyrood,"
and not wonder if there may not perhaps be
some need in your own soul of sanctuary.
Thousands and thousands of men&mdash;"abbey
lairds" as they were pleasantly called&mdash;have
stepped across this line before me, through the
centuries. Who am I to be different, unneedful?
May I not need inviolate sanctuary?
May it not be that at my heels dogs some sinister
creditor who will seize me by the skirts
before I reach the boundary beyond which there
is no exacting for debt? A marvelous thing,
this ancient idea of sanctuary. It made an oasis
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
of safety in a savage world. Surely it was
super-christian. And here, at Holyrood, as the
medieval statute declares, "qukilk privelege has
bene inviolabie observit to all maner of personis
cuman wythin the boundes ... past
memorie of man." What has the modern world
given itself in place of ancient sanctuary? Justice,
I suppose, and a jury trial.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i170.jpg" width="600" height="361" alt="HOLYROOD PALACE." title="" />
<span class="caption">HOLYROOD PALACE.</span>
</div>

<p>But, once across the Girth, one becomes, not
a sanctuarian, but a Stewart.</p>

<p>The situation is a little dreary, a little flat.
And the palace, as a palace, is altogether uninteresting
to look on. It is not the building
of David or of the earlier Stewarts. But of
that Merry Monarch who harboured so long in
France, when England was determining whether
it would be royal or republican, and Scotland
was determining whether it would be covenanted
or uncovenanted. The Merry Monarch
was ever an uncovenanted person, not at all
Scottish, although somewhat like the errant
James&mdash;whose errancy was of his own choosing.
Charles had acquired a French taste at
the court of his cousin, Louis the Grand. So
the new Holyrood was built in French baronial
style. And no monarch has ever cared to inhabit
it for any length of time. Only King Edward
VII, who would have been a happy suc<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>cessor
to James, but Edward was very studious
in those days of 1859, when he lodged here and
studied under the direction of the Rector of
the Royal High School. Still I can but think
that it was in this Stewart place that Edward
developed his Stewartship.</p>

<p>There is not a stone to speak of the magnificence,
of the strength, of David. The Abbey
was burned and burned again, by Edward and
Richard the Second, and entirely rebuilt when
the Stewarts were beginning to be splendid and
assured. Over the west doorway, high-arched
and deep-recessed, early English in its technique,
Charles I, who was crowned here in 1633,
caused the stone to be placed.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"He shall build ane House for my name and I will stablish
the throne of his kingdom forever."</p></div>

<p>The tablet still stands above the doorway.
But Charles is lying for his sins in a vault at
St. George's chapel at Windsor far in the south,
having paid his penalty on the scaffold in
Whitehall. And the House is in ruins, "bare
ruined choir," where not even "the late birds
sing." Although Mendelssohn in speaking of
the impression the Abbey made on him, does
say, "I think I found there the beginnings of
my Scotch symphony."</p>

<p>This "magnificent Abbey-Kirk of Halirude"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
was no doubt very splendid; although in architectural
beauty it cannot compare with Melrose,
not even the great east window with its rich
quatrefoil tracing. But what scenes have been
staged in that historic drama, that theatrical
piece, we call the history of the Stewarts!</p>

<p>Before the high altar, under that east window,
when James I was kneeling before God in
prayer, there appeared the Lord of the Isles,
come repentant from burning Inverness and
other rebellion, to kneel before the king, his
own sword pointed at his breast.</p>

<p>Before this altar James II was married to
Mary of Gueldres. James III was married to
Margaret of Denmark, who brought the Orkneys
as her dower. James IV was married to
Margaret Tudor, the union of the "Thistle and
the Rose." James V was not married here, he
went to France for his frail bride, Magdalene,
who lived but seven weeks in this inhospitable
land, this hospitable Holyrood. She was buried
in Holyrood chapel, only to be dug up and tossed
about as common clay when the Edinburgh citizens
made football of royal skulls.</p>

<p>The two sons of James VI, Henry who should
have been king and who might have united
royalist and commoner had fate granted it,
and Charles who was to become king, were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
both christened here. James VII, brother to
Charles II, restored this Chapel Royal and prepared
it for the Roman ritual. James VIII was
never here, or but as a baby. Charles III&mdash;did
the Bonnie Prince in that brief brilliant Edinburgh
moment of his, ever kneel before this
then deserted altar and ask divine favour while
he reasserted the divine right of kings?</p>

<p>Here&mdash;or was it secretly, in Stirling?&mdash;the
Queen&mdash;one says The Queen and all the world
knows&mdash;gowned in black velvet, at five o'clock
on a July morning, was married to her young
cousin, Henry Darnley. A marriage that endured
two long terrible tumultuous years.</p>

<p>Here&mdash;or was it in the drawing-room?&mdash;at
two o'clock on a May morning, the Queen was
married to Bothwell, by Adam Bothwell, Bishop
of Orkney, not with mass as she had been wed
to her boy-cousin, but with preaching as she
wed the Bishop's cousin. And "at this marriage
there was neither pleasure nor pastime
used as use was wont to be used when princes
were married." So says the Diurnal Occurents
of Scotland. A marriage that endured a
brief, perhaps happy, tragedy-gathering month.</p>

<p>And the Queen beautiful was destroyed, by
the Reformation, like an Abbey.</p>

<p>The bones of Darnley were ravaged by the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
citizens of Edinburgh out of the ruins of this
chapel. Or were they carried to Westminster
by that unroyal son who was so laggard in caring
for the remains of his queenly mother? I
hope that Darnley does not rest beside her.
For I think those exquisite marble fingers of
the effigy in Henry VII's chapel, looking I fain
believe as those of Mary looked, tapering,
lovely, sinister, would not so fold themselves in
prayer without unfolding through the long centuries.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i176.jpg" width="400" height="600" alt="JAMES IV." title="" />
<span class="caption">JAMES IV.</span>
</div>

<p>In the old palace the most glorious days were
those when James IV was king. As the most
glorious days of Scotland were those which are
almost legendary. The palace still had the
grandeur that was Norman and the grace that
was early English under David. Its front,
towered and pinnacled, suggesting more fortress
security than this dull ch&acirc;teau, opened
upon a great outer court that lay between the
palace and the walls. Coming down the Canongate
from the castle it must have looked very
splendid to James. And yet he did not care to
remain in it long. All the Stewarts had errant
souls, and they loved to wander their kingdom
through. It presented ample opportunity for
adventure; scarce a Stewart ever left Scotland.
That last Prince, who flashed across Scot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>land
in one last Stewart sword thrust&mdash;"My
friends," he said in Holyrood the night before
Prestonpans, "I have thrown away the scabbard"&mdash;was
but treading in the steps of his
royal forebears, the royal fore-errants.</p>

<p>In the days of James IV&mdash;we say it as one
should say in the days of Haroun al Raschid,
and indeed Edinburgh was in those early years
of the Fifteen Hundreds the Bagdad of the
world, and her days as well as her nights were
truly Arabian&mdash;the world must have looked
much as it does on the pleasant morning when
we make our royal entry into Holyrood.</p>

<p>The Abbey grounds, a regal area then, and
still a regality, were rich with woodland and
orchard, and terraced and flowered into southern
beauty. The red crags of the Salisbury
ridge rose bold above as they do to-day, and
crowning the scene the leonine form of Arthur's
Seat above the green slopes, the lion keeping
guard against the invading lion of England!
I think James must often have climbed to that
height to look forth over his domain, over his
city, to watch the world, as King Arthur&mdash;whom
he did not resemble&mdash;did legendary centuries
before.</p>

<p>It was a busy time in Edinburgh; men's
hands and wits were working. In Leith, then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
as now the port, then as now a separate burgh,
there was much shipping and much building of
ships; King James dreamed of a navy, and he
had an admirable admiral in Sir Anthony
Wood. In the castle there was the forging of
guns, the "seven sisters of Brothwick," under
direction of the king's master gunner, while
Mons Meg looked on, and perhaps saw the near
terrible future when these sisters of hers should
be lost at Flodden.</p>

<p>In the city there was the splendid beginning
of that intellectual life which has ever been
quick in Edinburgh. It was a joyous time; witness
the account from the lord High treasurer&mdash;</p>

<p>"On the 11th of February, 1488, we find the
king bestowing nine pounds on gentil John, the
English fule; on the 10th of June we have an
item to English pipers who played to the king
at the castle gate, of eight pounds eight shillings;
on the thirty-first of August Patrick
Johnson and his fellows, that playit a play to
the king, in Lithgow, receives three pounds;
Jacob the lutar, the king of bene, Swanky that
brought balls to the king, twa wemen that sang
to his highness, Witherspoon the foular, that
told tales and brought fowls, Tom Pringill the
trumpeter, twa fithelaris that sang Grey Steill
to the king, the broken-bakkit fiddler of St.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
Andrew's, Quhissilgyllourie a female dancer,
Willie Mercer who lap in the stank by the king's
command."</p>

<p>Oh, a royal and democratic and merry time.
It was Flodden that made men old, that tragic
climax to this splendour.</p>

<p>"In the joyous moneth tyme of June," in the
pleasant garden of the town-house of the great
Earl of Angus, looking down on the still waters
of the Nor' Loch, and across the woods and
moors to the glittering blue Firth, there sat the
pale stripling, Gavin Douglass, third son of
Douglass, Archibald Bell-the-Cat, late in orders
at Mony musk, but now come up to St. Giles
as prior in spite of his youth, and more absorbed
in poetry than men.</p>

<p class="poem">
"More pleased that in a barbarous age<br />
He gave rude Scotland Virgil's page,<br />
Than that beneath his rule he held<br />
The bishopric of fair Dunkeld."<br />
</p>

<p>Here I would dispute Scott. After all, Dark
Ages are not always as dark as they look to
those who come after. And if the "Dark
Ages" of Europe were brilliantly luminous in
Moslem capitals, Bagdad and Cordova, so
"rude Scotland" was more polished under
James IV than England under Henry VII, or
France under Louis XII.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>As Gavin has recorded in "The Palice of
Honour," he had interview with Venus in her
proper limbo, and she had presented him with
a copy of Virgil, bidding him translate it.
And so, quite boldly, before any Englishman
had ventured, and all through the winter, forgetful&mdash;except
when he wrote his prefaces of</p>

<p class="poem">scharp soppis of sleit and of the snypand snaw</p>

<p class="noidt">he had worked over his translation, from the
Latin into the Scottish, and now it was nearly
ready "to go to the printer," or more like, to be
shown to the king. In sixteen months he had
completed thirteen books; for he had added a
book of Maph&aelig;us Vegius, without discrimination.</p>

<p>He was certain of the passage <i>facilis descensus
Averni</i>, for Gavin was Scotch, the time was
Stewart. It ran in this wise&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"It is richt facill and eithgate, I tell thee<br />
For to descend, and pass on down to hell,<br />
The black zettis of Pluto, and that dirk way<br />
Stand evir open and patent nicht and day.<br />
But therefore to return again on hicht<br />
And heire above recovir this airis licht<br />
That is difficul werk, thair labour lyis,<br />
Full few thair bene quhom hiech above the skyis,<br />
Thare ardent vertue has raisit and upheit<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>All the mydway is wilderness unplane<br />
Or wilsum forest; and the laithlie flude<br />
Cocytus, with his drery bosom unrude<br />
Flows environ round about that place."<br />
</p>

<p>But he was not quite certain that he had been
splendid enough, and daring enough, in his application
of the royal lines&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">"Hic C&aelig;sar et omnis Iuli</span><br />
Progenies, magnum caeli ventura sub axem."<br />
</p>

<p>So he had sent for his friend, William Dunbar,
Kynges Makar, laureate to the sovereign.
And Dunbar was never loath for a "Flyting,"
a scolding. He had them on every hand, with
every one, and not only those he held with
"gude maister Walter Kennedy," and published
for the amusement of the King and his
Court. It was a more solemn event when the
future Bishop of Dunkeld summoned him.
Though Gavin was fifteen years younger than
William, he was more serious with much study,
and under the shadow of future honours, and
then, too, he was a Douglass.</p>

<p>So Dunbar came, striding up the Canongate
between the tall inquisitive houses&mdash;even he
found them "hampered in a honeycaim of their
own making"&mdash;a very handsome figure, this
Dunbar, in his red velvet robe richly fringed
with fur, which he had yearly as his reward<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
from the King, and which I doubt not he preferred
to the solemn Franciscan robe he had
renounced when he entered the King's service.</p>

<p>James was away at Stirling. James was a
poet also. Surely, on internal evidence, it is
the Fourth James and not the Fifth, who wrote
those charming, and improper poems, "The
Gaberlunzieman" and "The Jolly Beggar."</p>

<p class="poem">
"He took a horn frae his side, and blew baith loud and shrill,<br />
And four and twenty belted knights came skipping o'er the hill.<br />
<br />
"And he took out his little knife, loot a' his duddies fa';<br />
And he was the brawest gentleman that was amang them a'."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">"And we'll gang nae mair a roving,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">So late into the night;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">And we'll gang nae mair a roving, boys,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Let the moon shine ne'er so bright."</span><br />
</p>

<p>Dunbar, official Makar, would fain secure the
criticism of young Gavin on this joyous lament
he had writ to the King in absence&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"We that here in Hevenis glory ...<br />
I mean we folk in Paradyis<br />
In Edinburgh with all merriness."<br />
</p>

<p>And perhaps the young Gavin and the old
Dunbar in their common fellowship of poetry,
would drink a glass of red wine in memory of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
friends passed into death's dateless night&mdash;<i>Timor
Mortis conturbat me</i>.</p>

<p class="poem">
"He has Blind Harry and Sandy Traill<br />
Slaine with his schour of mortall haill....<br />
In Dunfermelyne he had done rovne<br />
With Maister Robert Henrisoun."<br />
</p>

<p>And Dunbar, who was so much more human
than Gavin, if older, would quote those immortal
new lines of Henryson&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"Robene sat on gude grene hill<br />
Kepand a flok of fe,<br />
Mirry Makyne said him till,<br />
Robene, thow pity on me."<br />
</p>

<p>While Gavin, so much elder than his looks,
and mindful of Scottish as well as of Trojan
history, would quote from Blind Harry in the
name of Wallace&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"I grant, he said, part Inglismen I slew<br />
In my quarrel, me thocht nocht halff enew.<br />
I mowyt na war but for to win our awin (own).<br />
To God and man the rycht full weill is knawin (known)."<br />
</p>

<p>Then Dunbar would wrap his rich red robe
about him&mdash;I hope he wore it on ordinary days,
or were there any when James the Fourth was
king?&mdash;and stride back, through the Canongate
to Holyrood, back to the court, where he would
meet with young David Lindsay, of a different<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
sort from young Gavin Douglass. And they
would chuckle over "Kitteis Confessioun," a
dialogue between Kitty and the curate, which
Lindsay had just written&mdash;and would not Dunbar
be gracious and show it to the King?</p>

<p class="poem">

</p>

<p>Perhaps Warbeck was listening, Perkin Warbeck
who pretended to be Duke of York, pretended
to the English crown. So Scotland harboured
him, and Holyrood was hospitable to
him. James married him to Lady Jane Gordon,
and for years, until he wearied of it, maintained

<span class="caption">MARGARET TUDOR, QUEEN OF JAMES IV.</span>
</div>

<p>I am certain that Dom Pedro de Ayala did
not linger in the court to gossip with Dunbar,
or with the hangers-on. Dom Pedro had come
up from Spain on a strange ambassadorial errand,
to offer to James in marriage a Spanish
princess, knowing well that there might be no
Spanish princess (Maria was betrothed to
Portugal); but no doubt believing that there
ought to be, since James was slow in marrying,
and surely a Spanish princess would best mate
this royalest of the Stewarts. Dom Pedro better
liked the extravagant kingly court at Holyrood
than the niggardly court at Windsor. He
wrote home to Ferdinand and Isabella, "The
kingdom is very old, and very noble, and the
king possessed of great virtues, and no defects
worth mentioning." No defects! Certainly
not. James had the qualities of his defects,
and these were royal. James could speak&mdash;not
keep still&mdash;in eight languages, and could and
did say "all his prayers." So Dom Pedro reports
to his Most Catholic Majesty.</p>

<p>When he was thirty years old, this King Errant
married, not the hypothetical daughter of
Spain, but the substantial youthful Margaret
Tudor, aged fourteen. The Scottish king would
none of the alliance for years; James preferred
hypothetical brides and errant affairs. But
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
the English king saw the advantage and pressed it.
He had united the roses, red and white, of England;
he would fain join the thistle to the
rose.</p>

<p>So James, in August, 1503, journeyed out to
Dalkeith, whither Margaret had come. He returned
to "hys bed at Edinborg varey well
countent of so fayr a meetyng." A few days
later, Margaret made her entry into Edinburgh,
James having met her, gallantly dressed in "a
jacket of crimson velvet bordered with cloth of
gold." Leaving his restive charger, "mounting
on the pallefroy of the Qwene, and the said
Qwene behind hym, so rode throw the towne
of Edinburgh." Their route lay through the
Grassmarket up to the Castle Hill, and down
the High Street and the Canongate, to the Abbey.
Here they were received by the Archbishop
of St. Andrews. Next day they were
married by the Archbishop of Glasgow, the
Archbishop of York joining in the solemn and
magnificent celebration.</p>

<p>It is the most splendid moment in Edinburgh
history, within the Abbey and the palace, and
within the city. The Town Cross ran with
wine, the high <i>lands</i> were hung with banners
and scarlet cloth, and morality plays were performed
before the people. In the palace there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
was a royal scene. And our friend, William
Dunbar, Kynges Makar, read his allegory of
"The Thrissl and the Roiss," which is still
worth reading, if Chaucer is worth reading.</p>

<p>But, at night, in the royal apartment, the
night before the wedding, perhaps in the fragment
of the old palace which remains, the gallant
king played to the little princess upon the virginal;
and then, on bended knee and with unbonneted
head, he listened while she played and
sang to him. Out of the dark of the time it is
a shining scene; and out of the splendour of
the moment it brings a note of tenderness.</p>

<p>Another decade, another August, and the
Boroughmoor (where now run the links of
Burntland) was covered with the white of a
thousand tents, Scotland was gathered for war,
the "ruddy lion ramped in gold" floated war-like
over all, and James and all Scotland prepared
to march down to Flodden, heeding not
the warning which had sounded at midnight in
ghostly voice at the Town Cross; a warning no
doubt arranged by Margaret, never a Stewart,
always a Tudor. And&mdash;all Scotland was turned
into a house of mourning.</p>

<p>Half a century later the history of Scotland
came to a climax, and Mary Stewart came to
Holyrood; that queen who then and ever since<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
held half the world in thrall, like another Iseult.
The covenanted world has rejected her, as no
doubt it would reject Iseult.</p>

<p>Shrouded in a gray "haar" from off the
North Sea, rising like a Venus out of the mists
of the sea, Mary Stewart, Dowager of France,
Queen of Scotland, Heiress of England, came
unto her own. And, her own received her, and,
received her not.</p>

<p>The castle hanging high in air no longer hung
there. The palace lying low on the plain was
not there, on that August 19, 1561. There was
nothing but what was near at hand; Mary could
not see a hundred feet into her kingdom. In
truth she arrived at port a week before the ship
was expected&mdash;and Mary also flashed through
her kingdom; witness the ride across the
Marches to the Hermitage, and the ride
through the North to punish Huntley. Hers
was a restless soul, a restless body.</p>

<p>On her return to the kingdom she was accompanied
by a great retinue, three of her French
uncles of Guise and of Lorraine, her four
Maries, and many ambassadors. It was a suspended
moment in the world, the sixth decade
of the sixteenth century. And nowhere were
affairs in such delicate balance, or so like to
swing out of balance as in Scotland; where re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>ligion,
sovereignty, feudalism, morality, were
swaying dizzily. So all the world sent their
keenest ambassadors to observe, to foresee if
possible, to report.</p>

<p>Yet Mary rode through the mists.</p>

<p>"Si grand brouillard," says the Sieur de
Brantome, that gossipy chronicler, and Mary
and her French courtiers and Scotch Maries,
rode through the "haar," from Leith up whatever
was the Leith Walk of that day to Holyrood.</p>

<p>The palace must have rung with French chatter,
of these wondering and inquisitive and critical
folk; for all the cultured world was French
in those days, and Mary and her Maries had
been only five or six when they left stormy
Scotland for the pleasant smiling land of
France.</p>

<p>Not for long was she permitted to believe she
had brought France back with her and there
was no reality in Scotland but as she made it.
Reformation pressed in upon her, even through
the windows of this turret where again she
seems to listen to that prophetic and pious
serenade, Scottish protestant psalms accompanied
by fiddles and sung to a French Catholic
queen. "Vile fiddles and rebecks," complains
Brantome, hesitating to call vile the mob<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
of five hundred gathered in the Scotch mists;
but they sang "so ill and with such bad accord
that there could be nothing worse. Ah, what
music, and what a lullaby for the night!"</p>

<p>The rooms of Mary are still inclosed, the
walls still stand about them, and a romantic
care withholds the ravages of time from those
tapestries and silken bed hangings, dark crimson
damask, which Mary drew about her on that
night of her return. And here hangs a picture
of Queen Elizabeth, authentic, Tudoresque,
which did not hang here when Mary returned;
but what dark shadow of Elizabeth lurked behind
these hangings! The very guard to whom
you protest the picture understands&mdash;"I think
it an insult to her memory."</p>

<p>It is here that Queen Mary still reigns. All
the old palace was burned, carelessly, by Cromwell's
soldiers, at what time men were caring
nothing for palaces, and less for royalty. But,
fate was royal, was Jacobite, and this gray
turret of the northwest corner a building of
James V on a foundation of James IV&mdash;perhaps
where he had listened in the evening to
Margaret and her virginal&mdash;was saved from the
wrath of the Commonwealth. Within these
very walls Mary played on the virginal, perhaps
on the rebeck, and many sought to know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
her stops&mdash;"you can fret me, yet you cannot
play upon me."</p>

<p>Here she was loved, as she still is loved.
Here she made love, the mystery!&mdash;as always.
Here she flashed those bright eyes on courtiers
and commoners and straightway these fell into
bondage&mdash;the Stewarts never drew the line of
division. Here those eyes battled with John
Knox as he met her in Dialogues, as John has
faithfully recorded. And here those bright
eyes filled with a storm of tears at his denunciation;
but Knox felt their power. Here she
met Darnley, in the chapel married him, and
Knox called after dinner to declare that the
Reformation did not approve. Here by the
very stairs of the turret Darnley led the murderers
on Rizzio, from his private apartments
to hers. (I find it fit that Ker of Fawdonside,
one of the murderers, should have married later
the widow of Knox.) Mary was held here a
prisoner; they would "cut her into collops and
cast her over the wall" if she summoned help.
But Mary could order that the blood stains of
the fifty-six wounds of Rizzio should remain
"ane memoriall to quychen her revenge."
They quicken our thought of Mary to-day&mdash;if
we accept them. From Holyrood Mary went
to Kirk o' Field on a Sunday night in February
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
to visit Darnley who lay "full of the small
pox." He had come back from Bothwell castle
on Mary's urging; but he had gone to Bothwell
to escape her revenge for Rizzio. She returned
to Holyrood&mdash;"the Queen's grace gang
and with licht torches up the Black Friar's
Wynd"&mdash;where the wedding festivities of a
member of her household were in progress.
And, I doubt not, devoted to Mary as I am, that
she was the merriest of the company.</p>

<p>Then the dark.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 374px;">
<img src="images/i198.jpg" width="374" height="600" alt="Bothwell Castle" title="" />
<span class="caption1">Bothwell Castle</span>
</div>

<p>Then, at two in morning, an explosion that
shook all Edinburgh, that astonished the world,
that still reverberates through the world.</p>

<p>Then&mdash;the dark.</p>

<p>A marriage, at two in the morning, a flight
to Borthwick, a meeting at Carberry, one more
night in Edinburgh, in a house as mean as that
of Kirk o' Field, a day at Holyrood, and a
forced ride with ruffian nobles, Lindsay and
Ruthven on each hand, to Loch Leven, thirty
miles in the night of June 16, 1567&mdash;and Edinburgh
and Holyrood and the Crown of Scotland
know her no more.</p>

<p class="poem">
"Helen's lips are drifting dust,<br />
Ilion is consumed in rust."<br />
</p>

<p>And Mary. And Holyrood.</p>

<p>There is one more Holyrood scene descend<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>ing
from this. On a Saturday evening, March
26, 1603, the son of Mary, the King of Scotland,
supped with the Queen, perhaps in that small
supper room where Rizzio was supping with a
queen; and they had retired. "The palace
lights were going out, one by one." And Sir
Robert Carey, three days out from London,
clattered into the courtyard, the King was
roused, Sir Robert knelt before him&mdash;</p>

<p>"Queen Elizabeth is dead, and Your Majesty
is King of England!"</p>

<p>James I of England, James VI of Scotland,
son of Mary, son of Darnley, son of the ninth
generation from Bruce, The Bruce. The "auld
enemy" is finally defeated; and to borrow again
from Rosaline Masson, "the lights of Holyrood
went out, one by one."</p>

<p>In the long picture gallery of this dull modern
palace, nothing of which either Mary or
James ever saw, there hangs a series of portraits,
one hundred pictures of Scottish kings,
painted under order of Charles II in 1680, by
the Fleming, DeWitt, who agreed to furnish the
pictures in two years for one hundred and
twenty pounds. They begin with Fergus I,
330 <span class="smcap">B. C.</span> They are the kings who passed before
the prophetic vision of Banquo. Enough to
frighten Macbeth!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>One brief brilliant ghost of Stewart glory returns.
In this gallery was held the ball of
Prince Charles Edward, described in "Waverley."</p>

<p>And after this theatric moment, and after the
Prince had defeated the "royalists" at Falkirk,
Hardy's dragoons slashed these pictures
of Scottish kings, since the Prince they could
not reach.</p>


<h4><i>Princes Gardens</i></h4>

<p>There are certain public places of beauty
where the beauty is so enveloping that the place
seems one's very own, seems possessed. That,
I take it, is the great democratic triumph, in
that it has made beauty a common possession
and places of beauty as free to the people as is
the air.</p>

<p>Chief of these is Princes Street Gardens.</p>

<p>I could, in truth I have, spent there days and
half-days, and twilights that I would willingly
have lengthened to midnights, since the northern
night never quite descends, but a romantic
gray twilight veils everything, and evokes more
than everything. For any lengthened visit in
Edinburgh I dare not inhabit a hotel room on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
the Garden side, since all my time would be
spent at the window. For a shorter visit, such
a room lengthens the day, defies the closed gate
of the Gardens.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i204.jpg" width="600" height="383" alt="PRINCES STREET." title="" />
<span class="caption">PRINCES STREET.</span>
</div>

<p>It was from such a window as this, "From a
Window in Princes Street" that Henley looked
forth&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"Above the crags that fade and gloom<br />
Starts the bare knee of Arthur's Seat;<br />
Ridged high against the evening bloom<br />
The Old Town rises, street on street;<br />
With lamps bejeweled, straight ahead,<br />
Like rampird walls the houses lean,<br />
All spired and domed and turreted,<br />
Sheer to the valley's darkling green;<br />
Ranged in mysterious array,<br />
The Castle menacing and austere,<br />
Looms through the lingering last of day;<br />
And in the silver dusk you hear,<br />
Reverberated from crag and scar,<br />
Bold bugles blowing points of war."<br />
</p>

<p>Princes Street is, I believe, not a mile long,
a half-mile the part which is gardened. It is
the loveliest street in the world. It seems infinite
instead of half-mile.</p>

<p>Of course to the loyal American that praise
is received half-way. For he remembers Riverside
Drive with the majesty of the Hudson,
North Shore Drive with the shoreless infinity
of Lake Michigan, Summit Avenue with the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
deep gorge of the Upper Mississippi, Quebec
and its Esplanade. But even these "handsome
streets" cannot match Princes for history and
beauty in one, for the old and the new, for the
Old Town and the New Town.</p>

<p>Princes Street, to speak briefly of its geography,
is a broad thoroughfare, with a medley
of buildings on the north side, but uniform in
gray stone, where hotels and shops furnish the
immediate life of the city. There are electric
cars running the full length of the street; and
it is the only street I know which is not spoiled
through the presence of these necessary carriers.</p>

<p>There are cabs, and there are sight-seeing
cars, from which in high advantage, and in half
a day, you can see everything in Edinburgh.
Yes, actually. I who speak to you have done
it, partly for the greed of seeing it steadily and
seeing it whole, and partly for the comment of
these Scotch coach drivers and guards, who are
not merely Scottish but the essence of Scotland.
I shall never forget how an American traveler&mdash;of
course they are all Americans in these tally-hos&mdash;commenting
on the driver's remark that
the "Old Queen" wanted to build a palace where
Donaldson's Hospital now stands and she was
refused&mdash;"but she was the Queen!" Neverthe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>less,
asserted Mr. Sandy Coachman, "She was
refused." Not so in the old days of Queenship.</p>

<p>The entire life of Edinburgh, of Scotland,
streams through this broad straight street.</p>

<p>On the opposite side lie the Gardens, stretching
their way parallel with the street, a wide,
green-lawned, tree-forested purlieu, terraced
and flowered, with a "sunken garden" near the
Castle-side, through which trains are conveyed.
The smoke, so much lamented, does often rest
with grace and gray loveliness in the hollows
of the place, so that one does not miss the waters
of the Nor' Loch that once flowed here as moat.</p>

<p>Above rises the castle in greater majesty
than from any other point. Down from the
castle runs the ridge of the High Street, and
the high <i>lands</i> with flags of washing hanging
out the windows which answer the flags red and
leoninely rampant, on the buildings of Princes
Street. The crown of St. Giles and the spire
of the Tronkirk hanging above all.</p>

<p>To the west is St. John's, where in the graveyard
Raeburn is buried; and old St. Cuthbert's,
where in the graveyard De Quincey is buried.
There are Raeburns in the Royal gallery which
stands on the island dividing the Gardens, and
there are many Raeburns here and there, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
private rooms of banks and other institutions,
rare Raeburns with that casual, direct, human
look he could give men and women. The galleries
are worth a visit both for their best, and
for their not-best. There are statues of famous
Scotsmen on the terraces, and of course the
Scott monument, beautifully Gothic, and as
sacred as a shrine.</p>

<p>There are goods to be bought in the shops,
pebbles and cairngorms in jewelry and kickshaws
of that ilk; rugs and plaidies, sashes and
ties, and Scott and Stevenson books bound in
the Royal Stewart silk. Unhappy the traveler
who has not provided himself beforehand with
a tartan. Almost every one can if he will. And
there is always the college of heraldry to help
one out. Or the audacity of choosing the tartan
you like best; an affront, I assure you, to
all good Scots. For however unlovely a Scotch
tartan may be in the eyes of the world&mdash;nominations
are invidious&mdash;in the eyes of the clansman
there is nothing so "right" as his own
particular tartan. He would not exchange it
for a Douglass or a Stewart.</p>

<p>These tartans have exerted a very marked
effect on the Scottish sense of taste. On
Princes Street you may not find such richly
dressed women as on Regent Street, but the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
harmony of colouring will please you better.
While no doubt this is due to the fact that for
several hundred years the Scottish taste has
had the benefit of intimate association with the
French, it can also be traced to the longer centuries
during which tartans have brought an
understanding of colour harmonies. Because
there has been this love of colour, there has
come with it vanity. With vanity there has
come that rare ability of the women of the race
to maintain a unity, a harmony, a complete relationship
between skirts and waists. There is
no country in Europe where the "act of union"
at the feminine waistline is so triumphant as
in Scotland, particularly in Edinburgh. The
universal American achievement has been
equaled in Europe only in Scotland.</p>

<p>There are teashops which invite you in, when
the wind sweeps too harshly, or the rain beats
itself into more than a Scotch mist, or even
when the sun shines too hot. There is a garden
tea place on top of a high hotel which confronts
the Castle. Even in this Far North
there is much open air dining, and more especially
open air tea-ing. I am not certain that
Dr. Johnson would have much cared for this
modern tea room, where he might review the
world. It seems that he drank much tea when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
he was the guest of Boswell, especially when he
was the guest of Mrs. Boswell, in James Court
the other side the Gardens. "Boswell has
handsome and very spacious rooms, level with
the ground on one side of the house, and the
other four stories high." And Boswell says
of Johnson, "My wife had tea ready for him,
which it is well known he delights to drink at
all times, particularly when sitting up late."
From this roof tea garden one can see James's
Court at the top of the Mound, although the
Boswell lodgings are burned down. And one
can almost see Holyrood, where tea was introduced
by James VII.</p>

<p>After you have shopped and had your tea,
and the past retakes possession, you will return
to the green valley of the Gardens, to forget the
clang of the tram cars, to look up at the great
Castle Hill, green until it meets the buff-coloured
stone and the buff-coloured buildings that
seem to grow out of the stone, if it is a clear
day; while the ramparts seem temporarily to
have blossomed with red geraniums, if red coats
are leaning over the edge.</p>

<p>A clear day in Edinburgh is possible. I have
spent a month of such days, and have longed
for the mists, a touch of them, that the castle
might turn to a purple wonder, and the deep<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
blue shadows sink over it, and the gray precipice
of the High Street look higher than ever. Gray
is in truth the colour of Edinburgh, "the gray
metropolis of the North." But it is never a
dreary gray, never a heavy gray like London.
There the gray is thick, charged with soot;
one can rub it from his face. In Edinburgh
the gray is luminous, a shifting playing colour,
with deep shadows turning to deep blue, with
rifts or thinnings of the cloud, through which
yellow and brown glimmers make their way.</p>

<p>Above all, Edinburgh is never monotonous.
That is perhaps its charm, a something that
every feminine city knows; Edinburgh is feminine,
and Paris, and Venice, and New Orleans.</p>

<p>And there hangs the castle, sometimes in
midair&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"Hast thou seen that lordly castle, that castle by the sea?<br />
Golden and red above it the clouds float gorgeously."<br />
</p>

<p>Sometimes standing stalwart and stern, a
challenge to daring, a challenge to history.
That farther edge of the Castle Hill as it is
silhouetted against the west sky&mdash;if you walk
around on Lothian Street you can see the full
face of the Rock&mdash;has invited many an adventurer,
both from within and without.</p>

<p>It was down that steep hill that the sons of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
Margaret carried their queen mother, when
the hosts of Donalbane were besieging the place,
and a Scotch "haar" rolling in from the sea
and shutting off the castle enabled the little
procession to pass safely with its precious burden,
and swiftly down to the Queen's ferry, and
across to Dunfermline.</p>

<p>Up the face of that Rock when The Bruce did
not hold this stronghold there stole in the night
of a thirteenth century winter&mdash;it must have
been much colder, even in Edinburgh, in the
thirteenth century&mdash;a picked band of men;
picked by Randolph afterward Earl of Moray,
and led by Frank, who, years before when he
had been a soldier in the castle garrison and
night leave was forbidden, used to make his
way down this cliff to visit a bonnie lassie in
the West Bow. Now, on a wind-swept night,
which can be very windy around that castle
profile&mdash;the wind has not abated since the thirteenth
century&mdash;Frank led the remembered
way. I wonder if he remembered the lassie.
But his footing was sure. Once, it is true, the
sentinel seemed to have discovered them. But
it was only the boast the sentinel makes to the
night when he makes his last round. The men
huddled against the face of the Rock. Then
they moved onward. The ladders were too<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
short to reach the rampart. Two were bound
together. The men over, the cry "A Moray!"
rings in the castle. Scotland has won it again.</p>

</div>

<p>Another century, and James III is king.
This least royal of the Stewarts, jealous of his
more royal brother, locked the Duke of Albany
in the castle, and felt secure. But the Duke
had friends. A French clipper came into Leith.
It brought wine to Albany, and the wine cask
contained a rope. Inviting his guardians to
sup with him, he plied them with heated wine,
perhaps drugged wine, then, the dagger. Albany's
servant insisted on going down the rope
first. It was short, he fell the rest of the distance.
Albany hurried back for the sheets from
his bed, made his safe way down. He carried
the servant man all the way to Leith&mdash;he had
just "whingered" the guard&mdash;found the boat,
and safety, and France.</p>

<p>Up the Rock, in Covenanting days, stole
Claverhouse, the Bonnie Dundee, to a secret
conference with the Duke of Gordon, hoping
to win him away to Stewart loyalty and the
North.</p>

<p>I cannot remember that any of Scott's characters
went this way. He thought it "scant
footing for a cat." But Stevenson knew the
way. Perhaps not actually, but he sent more
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
than one of his characters up or down the Rock&mdash;St.
Ives with a rope that was long enough to
reach.</p>


<h4><i>Calton Hill</i></h4>

<p>Perhaps the best view of Edinburgh&mdash;only
perhaps, for each view differs, and you have
not seen the whole city unless you have seen it
from the various vantage points&mdash;is that from
the Calton Hill. For a very good reason. The
Hill itself is negligible enough, although it is
impossible to understand Edinburgh, to understand
Scotland, unless you have looked on the
architectural remnants on this Hill, and considered
them philosophically. But, as Stevenson
said&mdash;"Of all places for a view, the Calton
Hill is perhaps the best; since you can see the
castle, which you lose from the castle, and Arthur's
Seat, which you cannot see from Arthur's
Seat." An excellent reason, which also
places the castle and Arthur's Seat.</p>

<p>Calton Hill does not tower so high over the
city as these other two points; one may still
look up to Arthur's Seat, one may look across
to the castle. Yet, the city lies near. Yet, the
country rolls out to the Firth, and out to the
Pentlands. Perhaps a gray-sea haze dulls the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
far edge of the far Kingdom of Fife. Perhaps
a blue haze hangs over the Pentlands. Perhaps
a smoke-cloud makes a nearer sky for the
town itself, this Auld Reekie. Not only perhaps,
but very probably. There are clear days
in Edinburgh. They are to be treasured.
There is no air more stimulating in all the
world. October sometimes slips into the other
months of the year, fills the air with wine, clears
the air of filament. But, not often, not often
for the tourist from beyond seas who makes
Edinburgh in the summer. But still it is possible
from Calton Hill to catch the farthest
glory of the encircling hills, and the near glory
of the ever glorious city.</p>

<p>The Hill itself is a place of monuments, and
a very pretentious place. Also, very absurd.
I suppose it is possible to be of two minds about
the remnant of the Parthenon which stands so
conspicuously on the highest plateau, a construction
dating back to that royal time when
George the Fourth came to this northern capital,
and was&mdash;alas!&mdash;received as though he
were Bonnie Prince Charlie himself; and was
received&mdash;again alas!&mdash;by Sir Walter clad in a
Campbell plaid, and as loyal to the Regent,
the florid Florizel, as he had been to Prince
Charles in the "Waverleys." Because of all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
these loyalties this never finished monument,
with its twelve columns and architrave spread
above, looks sufficiently pathetic, and sufficiently
absurd. "A very suitable monument to certain
national characteristics," said a later Scots
writer, who perhaps never ceased being a
Jacobite.</p>

<p>There are monuments; one to Dugald Stewart,
and the visitor not philosophical is apt to
ask, Who was Dugald Stewart? There is a
memorial to Burns whose friend Willie that
brewed a peck o' malt lies in the Old Calton
burying ground near by. Hume lies there,
too, and Dr. John Brown, and Stevenson's
dead.</p>

<p class="poem">
"There on the sunny frontage of a hill,<br />
Hard by the House of Kings, repose the dead,<br />
My dead, the ready and the strong of word.<br />
Their works, the salt-encrusted, still survive;<br />
The sea bombards their founded towers; the night<br />
Thrills pierced with their strong lamps. The artificers<br />
One after one, here in this grated cell,<br />
Where the rain erases and the dust consumes,<br />
Fell upon lasting silence."<br />
</p>

<p>There is a monument to Lord Nelson. And
looking as though he belonged there is a bronze
figure of Abraham Lincoln.</p>

<p>All this lies about, with casual sheep cropping
the grass.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>But, there lies the city. And there lies the
country.</p>

<p>To the south rises Arthur's Seat, the lion.
The much castellated jail, is beneath you, another
absurd elaborate building, a castle after
castle-days. Farther a-city lies Holyrood, with
the ruined abbey, the Queen Mary wing, and
the scarlet patch of the sentinel moving to and
fro and guarding all this vanished greatness.
Nothing more appeals than this sentinel-watch
of the ghosts of the past.</p>

<p>Turn but a little and the Old Town lies before
you, the castle splendid, still the guardian, the
long ridge of the High Street with its jagged
buildings that from here rise almost to the
purple edge of the hilly Pentland background,
with the spire of the Tolbooth and the crown of
St. Giles breaking against the sky. And down
at the foot of the vantage Hill stretches Princes
Street with the Scott monument rising athwart
the haze of city and sky.</p>

<p>From the north edge of Calton there is a more
empty panorama, but still significant. Now it
is bound in with tenements high and thick, but in
the golden days it was a steep hillside leading
down to a jousting ground. Tradition has it
that Bothwell launched his horse down its almost-precipice,
and so entered the tilting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
ground, while ladies' bright eyes rained influence
and gave the prize; but most glowing were
the eyes of Mary.</p>

<p>Beyond, the suburbs fill in the two miles that
stretch to Leith, and to the Firth, glittering
out to the far sea.</p>

<p>At night, if you have no fear of hobgoblins
or of hooligans, Calton Hill is an experience.
It is a still place, the silence the greater because
the city lies so near, and looks so busy with its
twinkling lights. A gulf of gloom lies between.
The night is velvet black, a drop curtain against
which is thrown the star-pricked map of the
city. One can well believe how the young
Stevenson, in those romantic days when he
carried a lantern under his jacket, used to
climb this hill venturesomely, and with the dog
in "Chanticler," exclaim, "I shall never forget
the first night I lapped up the stars." It
is something to lap stars from the black pool
which is Edinburgh by night.</p>

<p>If you have, happily, lived in a high city,
Boston, Seattle, Duluth, Denver, St. Paul, San
Francisco, with water and land combined, you,
too, have lingered upon a heaven-kissed hill on
such a night as this, and Edinburgh seems native.</p>

<p>Scott, of course, must have known Calton<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
Hill, although Salisbury Crags under Arthur's
Seat, with its more feasible promenade, better
appealed to him when he was writing the
"Waverleys." There is an American who has
written of the Hill, a young inland American
whom the gods loved to an early death. I remember
hearing Arthur Upson talk of days and
nights on the Calton, and his sonnet catches
the note&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"High and alone I stood on Calton Hill<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Above the scene that was so dear to him</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Whose exile dreams of it made exile dim.</span><br />
October wooed the folded valleys till<br />
In mist they blurred, even as our eye upfill<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Under a too-sweet memory; spires did swim,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And gables, rust-red, on the gray sea's brim&mdash;</span><br />
But on these heights the air was soft and still,<br />
Yet, not all still; an alien breeze will turn<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Here, as from bournes in aromatic seas,</span><br />
As round old shrines a new-freed soul might yearn<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With incense of rich earthly reveries.</span><br />
Vanish the isles: Mist, exile, searching pain,<br />
But the brave soul is freed, is home again."<br />

<small>THE KINGDOM OF FIFE</small></h2>



<div class="figleft" style="width: 68px;">
<img src="images/letter-f.jpg" width="68" height="75" alt="F" title="F" />
</div>
<p class="dropcap">rom Edinburgh as I looked out on the
Forth from every vantage point, I was
conscious of the hills of Fife ever backing
in the prospect. And I kept repeating to
myself the old rhyme of the witches&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"The Thane of Fife had a wife,<br />
Ah, where is she now!"<br />
</p>

<p>I determined to set sail and find not the wife,
but the kingdom.</p>

<p>It is a continuing splendour, this name&mdash;the
Kingdom of Fife. Than the thing nothing
could be less royal, more democratic. For
Fifeshire is given over to farm lands and coal
fields and treeless stretches, and the fringe of
Fife is made up of fishing villages "a hodden
gray plaid wi' a gowden fringe," said a King
Jamie. It lies there, separate from Scotland,
although very Scottish, between the firths of the
Forth and the Tay, with the Ochil hills a barrier
on the landside. The separating firths are now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
connected with Scotland by great bridges, over
which the trains pass with reluctance. And
the wind is always blowing in Fife, a cold, stern,
relentless, Calvinistic wind, off the North Sea.
Not by every wind of doctrine but by a disciplining
Calvinistic wind is this Kingdom swept into
conformity.</p>

<p>There is no end of castles and of historic
memories lying like pebbles upon the seashore
of the Firth. Pick up any sea shell&mdash;I do not
remember seeing any, so combed have these
beaches been from the memory of man&mdash;and it
will whisper a tale in your ear.</p>

<p>But there is for me but one pilgrimage to be
made in Fifeshire, to Kirkcaldy; to the place,
not of Ravenscraig Castle, nor because Adam
Smith and political economy were here born
twins, nor because Carlyle taught here for two
years, nor because Edward Irving preached
here; their dwellings and schools and graves
can be seen. But because Marjorie Fleming
was born here, passed to and fro, from Granton
to Burntisland, in those brief beautiful nine
years that were granted to her, and to us, and
lies buried in the old kirkyard of Abbotshall.</p>

<p>Perhaps you do not know Marjorie. She
was the friend, the intimate friend of Sir Walter
Scott. And I can but think how large and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
void the world was a century ago, in that
Charles Lamb was living in London when Marjorie
was living in Kirkcaldy, and was dreaming
of his "Dream Children," when he might
have known this most precious child, fit to be
the friend of Lamb as she was of Sir Walter.</p>

<p>Other men who have loved her with a tenderness
which can belong but to the living child,
immortally living, are Dr. John Brown who
wrote the wonder book about her fifty years
ago, through which most of us have claimed
Marjorie as our own, and Mark Twain, who
only a month before he died&mdash;and joined her&mdash;wrote
as tenderly and whimsically of her as he
ever wrote of any child or any maid. Among
such august company we almost hesitate to enter,
but surely at this distance of time we may
lay our love beside that of the great men who
found Pet Marjorie one of the most precious
human treasures the world has ever held.</p>

<p>She was but a little girl, and only nine years
all told, when the last day came to her a hundred
and more years ago, December 19, 1811.
The first six years she lived in Kirkcaldy, "my
native town which though dirty is clene in the
country," Marjorie wrote this from Edinburgh
a little patronizingly, and Marjorie was never
strong on spelling. The next three years she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
lived with her aunt in the Scottish capital, where
she wrote those journals and letters which have
kept her memory warm to this day. In July
of 1811 she returned to the town by the North
Sea, and in December she was gone.</p>

<p>In the morning of the day on which I made
my pilgrimage I went up to the Parliament
buildings in the Old Town, looked them about,
saw the lawyers pacing to and fro, as Stevenson
had paced, but not for long&mdash;the absurdity
of it!&mdash;and then down the hill in the shadow of
three men.</p>

<p>"One November afternoon in 1810"&mdash;(the
year in which the "Lady of the Lake" was published)
"three men, evidently lawyers, might
have been seen escaping like school boys from
the Parliament House, and speeding arm in
arm down Bank Street and the Mound, in the
teeth of a surly blast of sleet." They were
Lord Erskine, William Clerk&mdash;and the third we
all know; what service of romance has he not
performed for us! As the snow blattered in
his face he muttered, "how it raves and drifts!
On-ding o' snaw&mdash;aye, that's the word, on-ding."
And so he approached his own door,
Castle Street, No. 39. There, over the door,
looking forth on the world, is his face to-day,
looking up Young Street.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, as he grew restless and would awa, I
followed him through Young Street up to No. 1,
North Charlotte Street. It is a substantial
building, still of dignified and fair estate;
neighbourhoods are not transformed in a Scots
century as they are in America. But it carries
no tablet to tell the world that here Marjorie
lived. It was here that at the age of six she
wrote her first letter to Isa Keith. It was
here that Marjorie saw "regency bonnets" and
with eyes of envy; as indeed she envied and desired
with the passionate depths of her nature
all lovely and strange things. Here she read
the Newgate calendar, and found it a fascinating
affair&mdash;Marjorie less than nine! And here
that Isabel Keith, her adored cousin, would not
permit the little bookworm to read much of
lovers or to talk of them. Marjorie says very
gravely, "a great many authors have expressed
themselves too sentimentally," but Isa was
never able quite to cure Marjorie of her interest
in love.</p>

<p>That evening Sir Walter carried her, through
the "on-ding o' snaw," in a shepherd's plaid,
over to Castle Street. I walked through the
narrow stone-lined thoroughfare on a hot July
morning&mdash;and I could feel the cold and snow of
that winter a century back, and see the strong,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
lame, great man, carrying the wee wifie in the
neuk of his plaid, to the warm firelight of his
castle. Marjorie and he would romp there the
evening long. She would hear him say his
lessons, "Ziccoty, diccoty, dock," or "Wonery,
twoery, tickery, seven," while Marjorie "grew
quite bitter in her displeasure at his ill behaviour
and stupidness."</p>

<p>Then they would read ballads together; and
then "he would take her on his knee, and make
her repeat Constance's speeches in King John
till he swayed to and fro sobbing his fill.
Fancy the gifted little creature, like one possessed,
repeating&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"'For I am sick, and capable of fears,<br />
Oppressed with wrongs, and therefore full of fears;<br />
A widow, husbandless, subject to fears;<br />
A woman, naturally born to fears.'"<br />
</p>

<p>I walked out through what used to be fields,
and is now much suburban dwelling, toward
Braehead.&mdash;"I am going to-morrow to a delightful
place, Braehead by name, where there
is ducks, cocks, bubblyjocks, 2 dogs, 2 cats and
swine which is delightful"&mdash;to Ravelston&mdash;"I
am at Ravelston enjoying nature's fresh air.
The birds are singing sweetly, the calf doth
frisk and nature shows her glorious face."</p>

<p>Ravelston is still a place of delight, with its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
great cliffs breaking the surface of the park and
a deep-lying lake with dark woodlands. I wish
Marjorie might have known the ballad by Sydney
Dobell; it has the magic quality she would
have felt.</p>

<p class="poem">
"Ravelston, Ravelston,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The merry path that leads</span><br />
Down the golden morning hill,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And through the silver meads;</span><br />
<br />
"She sang her song, she kept her kine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She sat beneath the thorn,</span><br />
When Andrew Keith of Ravelston<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Rode thro' the Monday morn.</span><br />
<br />
"Year after year, where Andrew came,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Comes evening down the glade,</span><br />
And still there sits a moonshine ghost<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where sat the sunshine maid.</span><br />
<br />
"She makes her immemorial moan,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She keeps her shadowy kine;</span><br />
O Keith of Ravelston<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sorrows of thy line!"</span><br />
</p>

<p>In the late afternoon I took tram for Leith,
changing of course at Pilrig, because Leith remains
haughtily aloof from Edinburgh and emphasizes
it through this break at the boundary.
"When we came to Leith," says Boswell, "I
talked perhaps with too boasting an air, how
pretty the Frith of Forth looked; as indeed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
after the prospect from Constantinople, of
which I have been told, and that from Naples,
which I have seen, I believe the view of the Frith
and its environs from the Castle-hill of Edinburgh
is the finest prospect in Europe, 'Aye,'
replied Dr. Johnson, 'that is the state of the
world. Water is the same everywhere.'"</p>

<p>And so, down to the pier, stopping on the
way to look at a New Haven fishwife in her
picturesque costume, which she has worn ever
since the Danes came over. Yes, and looking
for a suitable piece of earth for Queen Magdalene
to kiss, "Scottis eard!" Well, if not here,
there is Scottis eard worthy elsewhere.</p>

<p>I asked for the ferry to Burnt-is-land. The
conductor of the tram looked, yes, and laughed.
Burnt-island, he dared, <i>dared</i> to repeat. And
so, I took ferry from Granton to&mdash;Burnt-island.</p>

<p>It is a long journey across the Firth. Far
down the waters rises the bold rock of the
Bass, around which I had sailed a day before,
looking for a landing for some one more ponderous
than solan geese or kittie wake, and not
finding it; although I was told that from Canty
bay&mdash;excellent Scots name&mdash;the innkeeper will
row you o'er, and you may walk where James I
was waiting for the boat which should carry
him to safety in France, and getting instead the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
boat which carried him to prison in England.
Still I like to remember that Henry IV declared
in explanation that he "could speak very good
French" himself, if that were what they were
sending Scottish Jamie o'er the water for;
Henry who had years of the Hundred Years'
War behind him.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i230.jpg" width="600" height="352" alt="TANTALLON CASTLE." title="" />
<span class="caption">TANTALLON CASTLE.</span>
</div>

<p>The rock is rent by a cavern running clean
through. It's quite a terrific place, and seven
acres of benty grass must have seemed small
refuge for the Covenanters who were lodged
here numerously in Killing Time.</p>

<p>On the mainshore, the Lothian, rises Tantallon
Castle, where Marmion dared to beard
Angus Bell-the-Cat. It still looks pretty tremendous,
and still stands, like the Coliseum.
"Ding doon Tantallon? Build a brig to the
Bass!" runs the proud proverb.</p>

<p>But we are on our way across the Firth.
There was a certain magic about it on my day
of pilgrimage. The north shore lay sparkling
in the late afternoon sun, blue shimmering land
against a clear blue sky, the thin rim of the
continent playing here and there with opalescent
colour where man had builded village or
castle, or where man had not destroyed the
ancient green. The south shore lay vague and
gray, and growing darker, against the falling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
afternoon, while the Lammermuirs stood up in
paler dusk in the background, and the sun
blazed behind them. And all about the Firth
glittered like an inland lake, a Great Lake. I
thought of how the Roman galleys and Norse
fleets had come this way, and looked and departed.
And how kings had brought their
armies here, and looked, perhaps besieged, and
departed. And how time and time and time
again, French fleets had sailed in here to help
their continuing ally, Scotland. And how kings
had sailed out from here to France, and how
Scots knights had sailed out from here for
France, the Crusades, anywhere that promised
adventure. And here Saxon Margaret had
sailed in to be Scotland's queen. And here
Scottish Mary had sailed in to be Scotland's
queen, and not to be. Far out in the offing the
sun shone golden upon the brown sails of a
single fishing boat, tacking to catch a homing
wind, a ghost where once had sailed the war
and merchant fleets of nations.</p>

<p>At Burntisland I did not pause to visit Rossend
Castle where Mary is supposed to have
had her affair with Chastelard; certainly not.
Nor at Kinghorn, where Alexander III, within
a few months after he had married in haunted
Kelso, and within a few hours perhaps after he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
had drunk the blude red wine in Dunfermline,
came galloping by this way, the horse stumbled,
the king fell, and</p>

<p class="poem">
"Quhen Alysandyr oure King was dede<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That Scotland led in luve and le ...</span><br />
Succoure Scotland and remede<br />

</p>


<h4><i>Kirkcaldy</i></h4>

<p>If Kirkcaldy was a "lang toun" in the olden
days, it is longer to-day, stretching from Linktown
to Dysart, and broadening inland to Gallatown,
where they make the famous Wemyss
pottery. To-day Kirkcaldy makes linoleum and
jute and engineering works, and it is the center
of a string of fishing villages, a "metropolitan
borough system," hundreds of boats fishing the
North Sea with KY marked as their home port,
when their sailor men make home in any of
these picturesque and smelling villages, St.
Monan, Pittenweem, Cellardyke, Crail where
Mary of Lorraine landed, Largo where Sir Andrew
Wood the admiral lived, and where Alexander
Selkirk lived what time he did not live
as Crusoe in Juan Fernandez, and Anstruther<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"Wha wad na be in love<br />
Wi' bonny Maggie Lauder,<br />
A piper met her gaen to Fife<br />
And speired what wast they ca'd her....<br />
I've lived in Fife<br />
Baith maid and wife<br />
These ten years and a quarter,<br />
Gin ye should come to Anster Fair<br />
Speir ye for Maggie Lauder."<br />
</p>

<p>There is also some castellated splendour,
Ravenscraig, and Wemyss on the site of the
castle of MacDuff, then of Fife, this Wemyss
being the ill-fated place where Mary first met
Darnley.</p>

<p>Abbotshall kirkyard is at the right of the railway
station as the train pulls in to Kirkcaldy.
In his book of Scotch pilgrimages when William
Winter was on his way to St. Andrews, past
Kirkcaldy, he wrote "gazing as I pass at its
quaint church among the graves." I suppose
he did not know what grave.</p>

<p>But first I would find where she had lived.
Kirkcaldy is close set against the sea. Here
on winding High Street, I found the house in
which she had lived, standing much as it did
no doubt a hundred years ago, except for a new
coat of tan on the stone. From those upper
windows Marjorie looked out on the coach go<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>ing
away toward Edinburgh. The ground floor
is occupied by a book store, where I could buy
no book about Marjorie. Under a window you
enter the archway and find yourself in a little
green-grassed court, which is all that is left of
Marjorie's garden. The house proper fronted
the garden in that comfortable excluding way
which British people still prefer for their places
of habitation. It is still occupied as a dwelling,
and the nursery still looks as it did in Marjorie's
day, and the drawing-room, where she
wrote that letter to Isa Keith&mdash;"I now sit
down on my botom to answer all your kind and
beloved letters." The door of the nursery was
open. I remembered those last days, when lying
ill, her mother asked Marjorie if there was
anything she wished. "Oh, yes, if you would
just leave the room door open a wee bit, and
play 'The Land o' the Leal,' and I will lie still
and think and enjoy myself."</p>

<p class="poem">
"I'm wearin' awa', Jean,<br />
Like snaw wreaths in thaw, Jean,<br />
I'm wearin' awa',<br />
To the Land o' the Leal."<br />
</p>

<p>The kirkyard lies on the outskirts of the town.
It was a beautiful place as the Scotch sun sank
behind the Fife hills and the Firth. The or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>ganist
was playing and the music drifted out
through the narrow lancet windows when I
found the little white cross marked "Pet Marjorie,"
and the old gray tombstone with its
simple token, "M. F. 1811."</p>

<p>For a hundred years then she has been lying
there. But Marjorie has become one of the immortal
dream children of the world. I laid my
fresh flowers beside another's which had withered,
and went my ways into the dusk.</p>


<h4><i>St. Andrews</i></h4>

<p>Past Kirkcaldy the road leaves the sea and
runs northward through meadows between
fields which have the look of centuries-old cultivation,
at peace like the fields and villages of
the English Midland, to St. Andrews.</p>

<p class="poem">
"St. Andrews by the Northern Sea,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A haunted town it is to me!</span><br />
A little city, worn and gray,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The gray North Ocean girds it round;</span><br />
And o'er the rocks, and up the bay,<br />
The long sea-rollers surge and sound;<br />
And still the thin and biting spray<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Drives down the melancholy street,</span><br />
And still endure, and still decay,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Towers that the salt winds vainly beat.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>Ghost-like and shadowy they stand<br />
Dim mirrored in the wet sea-sands.<br />
<br />
"St. Leonard's Chapel, long ago<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We loitered idly where the tall</span><br />
Fresh-budded mountain ashes blow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Within thy desecrated wall;</span><br />
The tough roots rent the tombs below,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And April birds sang clamorous,</span><br />
We did not dream, we could not know<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How hardly Fate would deal with us!</span><br />
<br />
"O broken minster, looking forth<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beyond the bay, above the town,</span><br />
O winter of the kindly North,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O college of the scarlet gown!"</span><br />
</p>

<p>Small wonder St. Andrews is the ecclesiastical
capital of Scotland, and smaller wonder, remembering
the Calvinistic wind, that here happened
the brunt of the fight between the old
faith and the new.</p>

<p>It is a clean and seemly town, with much
historic memory and much present day dignity,
a small gray town, "the essence of all the antiquity
of Scotland in good clean condition,"
said Carlyle. Its ancient sights the cathedral
and the castle; its living sight the university
and the golf links.</p>

<p>The town stands on a promontory, three long
streets converging on the cathedral and castle
lying in ruins. The cathedral, a hundred years
in the building, and very splendid in its wealth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
of detail, its vastness of space like that of York
or Amiens, was dedicated in the days of The
Bruce, with the king present to endow it with
a hundred marks "for the mighty victory of the
Scots at Bannockburn, by St. Andrew's, the
guardian of the realm." For three hundred
years its wax tapers lighted the old rites according
to which The Bruce worshiped; he was
not covenanted. Then the torch of the reformation
was applied to it, the torch of the flaming
tongue of John Knox.</p>

<p>To-day there are three towers left of the five&mdash;Dr.
Johnson hoped that one which looked unstable
on the day of his visit, would "fall on
some of the posterity of John Knox; and no
great matter!" There are massive walls.
There is no roof between us and the sky, which,
after all, does shelter the true faith, and if one
misses the chanting of the monks echoing
through these arches, under this roofless space,
there is the moan of the sea, sobbing at the foot
of the crag, the sea which is of no faith and
never keeps faith. And if one misses the scarlet
robes of Cardinal Beaton as he swept
through these aisles in splendid procession with
all the gorgeous trappings of his retinue, there
are mosses and wild flowers to give glows of
colour&mdash;one must content himself. Those were

evil days, whatever the faith; there was not

have been in matters of morals.</p>

<img src="images/i240.jpg" width="600" height="353" alt="ST. ANDREWS CASTLE." title="" />
<span class="caption">ST. ANDREWS CASTLE.</span>
</div>

<p>The castle stands stalwart on the rock promontory
washed by the ocean, and the ocean
breaks angrily at its base like a creature robbed
over long of its prey. It is not the castle in
which the Cardinal lived, but it was built soon
after, and wrecked so thoroughly, and looks so
very ancient, that one would fain believe; and
the guide will tell, unless you prevent him, that
it was at these windows that the Cardinal sat
at his ease and witnessed the entertainment of
the auto da fe of the non-conformist, George
Wishart, burned alive on March 28, 1542; about
the time Philip the Second was burning heretics
in the Old Plaza at Madrid, and a little before
Queen Mary spouse to Philip, was burning
them in England. And it was only two
months later, May 29, when workmen were
strengthening the castle at the orders of the
Cardinal against this very thing that happened,
that the reformers made their way in, killed the
Cardinal, and hung him "by the tane arm and
the tane foot," from the very balcony where
he had sat to enjoy Wishart's burning. A very
barbarous time. As Wishart had lain in the
Bottle Dungeon months before his burning, so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
Beaton lay in the dungeon in salt, seven months
before his burial.</p>

<p>John Knox joined the reformers, holding the
town until it was taken by the French fleet&mdash;"defended
their castle against Scotland,
France, and Ireland all three"&mdash;surrendering
to Strozzi, Prior of Capua, a Knight of
Rhodes; so was the great world made small in
those days by errant knights and captains and
hired mercenaries. The French captain entered,
"and spoiled the castle very rigorously,"
lest it should be "a receptacle for rebels." All
this in the time of the Regency of Mary of
Lorraine.</p>

<p>Knox was taken and sent to the galleys for
a year. Then he returned, and was frequently
in St. Andrews, preaching in the town kirk,
founded, perhaps, by the confessor of Saint
Margaret, preaching here some of his last sermons.
"I saw him everie day of his doctrine
go hulie and fear," wrote James Melville, "with
a furrning of martriks about his neck, a staff
in the an hand," and lifted up to the pulpit
"whar he behovite to lean at his first entrie;
bot or he had done with his sermont, he was so
active and vigorus, that he lyk to ding that
pulpit in blads and fly out of it." The pulpit
held. And so did the doctrine of Knox.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>The square tower of St. Regulus, a pre-Norman
bit of architecture, perhaps Culdee, stands
southeast of the cathedral. Dr. Johnson was
indignant with Boswell that he missed it. This
with the many other towers of church and college
make St. Andrews a towered town.</p>

<p>There is an air, an atmosphere, in St. Andrews;
it is an academic town, serene, certain
of itself, quiet, with wide streets and gray stone
buildings. It is full of dignity, full of repose,
as a northern Oxford combined with a northern
Canterbury should be. There is a spell of ancientry
over the gray old walls, but it is unbroken
ancientry; if there is a bar sinister, the
present generation has forgotten it.</p>

<p>And, of course&mdash;oh, not of course, but primarily&mdash;there
is golf. There is golf everywhere
in Scotland. The golf ball and not the
thistle is the symbol of Scotland to-day, and
from the Tee at St. Andrews the Golf Ball has
been driven round the world. James VI, careful
Scot, recognized golf as an industry, and
granted letters patent in 1618 for the manufacture
of golf balls&mdash;the old leather, feather-stuffed
sphere&mdash;to James Melville and William
Berwick.</p>

<p>Edinburgh is ringed about with golf courses,
public and private. So is Scotland. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
Firth of Forth is continuous with them, from
North Berwick where the fleeting traveler is as
certain to see golf balls as he is to see the Bass,
up to St. Andrews. The Links of Leith are the
most historic, for it was on these that Charles
I was playing when news came of the Irish rebellion&mdash;and
all that it led to. And here, his
son, later James II, played against two English
noblemen who had declared they could beat
him, and James, cannily&mdash;true Scot!&mdash;chose the
best player in Scotland, one Paterson an Edinburgh
cobbler&mdash;and gave him the wager, and
doubled it, out of which Paterson built for himself
Golfer's <i>Land</i> in the Canongate. The
Links of the Forth are not a golf course, although
there may be some who assert that they
were once an ancient course, say, for King
Arthur and his Knights.</p>

<p>Sealand, shoreland, it seems, makes the ideal
golf course, the soil growing with short crisp
grass that makes a springy and slippery turf,
and makes a keen game; the inlander, of course,
and the American inlander, may not understand
that golf can never quite be golf, certainly
never be the true Scottish rite, unless it
is played near the sea, with the tang of the sea
and of golf entering into one's blood&mdash;and, preferably
at St. Andrews.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>At St. Andrews golf is a business, a sublimated
business; or better, an education. Degrees
are taken in it quite as high and requiring
as thorough a training as at the University.
It is to St. Andrews that the good golfer goes
when he dies. And he aspires to go there before.</p>

<p>Or, rather at St. Andrews golf is a religion.
Half the stories told of golf are, as might be
expected of a game which came to its flowering
in Scotland, religious, or irreligious. And one
of the best of them is told in Stewart Dick's
book on "The Forth." A Scots minister was
playing and playing rather badly, and expressing
himself in words if not in strokes. (Only
those of you who have read "Sentimental
Tommy" will understand that unconsciously I
have played on the word "stroke!") The minister
exclaimed bitterly as he emerged from his
unholy battle with the bunker&mdash;is Bunker Hill,
perhaps a hazard in golf?&mdash;"Ah maun gie it
up! ah maun gie it up!" "What!" cried his
partner alarmed, "gie up gowf?" "Naw,
naw," returned the minister, "gie up the meenistry."</p>

<p>Perhaps to amend again, golf at St. Andrews
is life. And in their death they are not divided.
The graveyard near the Abbey, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
stones hoary from the sixteenth century, is
renowned to-day because it contains the graves
of good golfers, Allan Robertson, old Tom Morris,
and young Tom Morris, the greatest golfer
since Paterson, dead at the pathetic age of 24;
after that comes a man's best golfing years,
that is, for his pleasure. Young Tom's grave
is marked by an elaborate monument with an
inscription that befits a king.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI<br />

<small>TO THE NORTH</small></h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 68px;">
<img src="images/letter-o.jpg" width="68" height="75" alt="O" title="O" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">ne leaves Edinburgh for the North&mdash;the
haunted North&mdash;as in a royal progress.
The train moves out of the Waverley station,
and through the Gardens, under the very
shadow of Castle Rock.</p>

<p>And it moves through the scant few miles of
country, richly cultivated, suburban fairly, yet
there are level wheatlands, and country cottages
and orchards; it is southern, English,
these few miles down to the Forth.</p>

<p class="poem">
"The blackbird sang, the skies were clear and clean,<br />
We bowled along a road that curved its spine<br />
Superbly sinuous and serpentine<br />
Thro' silent symphonies of summer green,<br />
Sudden the Forth came on us&mdash;sad of mien,<br />
No cloud to colour it, no breeze to line;<br />
A sheet of dark dull glass, without a sign<br />
Of life or death, two beams of sand between,<br />
Water and sky merged blank in mist together,<br />
The Fort loomed spectral, and the Guardship's spars<br />
Traced vague, black shadows on the shimmery glaze:<br />
We felt the dim, strange years, the gray, strange weather,<br />
The still, strange land, unvexed of sun or stars,<br />
Where Lancelot rides clanking thro' the haze."<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>To every one comes this sense of strange
years and a strange land, even at Queensferry,
even to Henley.</p>

<p>The inn, where we have all put up in imagination,
with Scott, and again with Stevenson,
lies under the bridge, as though it would escape
the quick curious gaze from these iron girders
so high above what Scott ever dreamed or
Davy Balfour. And then, the train creeps out
over this modern audacity, this very ugly iron
spanning of the river. Fortunately we are
upon it and cannot see its practical, monstrous
being, "that monster of utility," as Lord Rosebery
called it. He should know its phrase,
since it is ever present in the view from his
Dalmeny Park, lying east of the Bridge and
south of the Forth.</p>

<p>This is precisely where Queen Margaret was
ferried to and fro a thousand years ago. The
monks who had charge of the ferry took from
the toll every fourth and every fortieth penny&mdash;a
delightful bit of geometric finance. Who
could calculate and who would dispute the calculation,
of fourth and fortieth?</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<h4><i>Dunfermline</i></h4>

<p class="poem">
"The King sits in Dunfermline toun<br />
Drinking the blude-red wine."<br />
</p>

<p>Because of such lines as these I would cross
far seas, merely to have been, if far lonely destructive
centuries after, in the very place of
their being.</p>

<p>For Dunfermline is surely a very kingly
name for a king's town, and "blude-red" wine
is of such a difference from mere red, or blood-red
wine. What wonder that Alexander III,
of whom it is written, went to his death over
at Kinghorn in such a tragic way!</p>

<p>But the king who forever sits in Dunfermline
is that Malcolm of the eleventh century who
brings hither something more than legend yet
something as thrilling, as "authentic" as legend.
Malcolm is the son of Duncan, in Shakespeare's
play, and in history.</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">"The son of Duncan</span><br />
From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth,<br />
Lives in the English court; and is received<br />
Of the most pious Edward with such grace<br />
That the malevolence of fortune nothing<br />
Takes from his high respect."<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>Malcolm, after "the deep damnation of his
taking off," fled from the red wrath of Macbeth
and into the far prophecy of Banquo, to
the court of Edward the Confessor. There
perhaps he met Margaret; or perhaps not, since
she was grand-niece to the Confessor, and Malcolm
was a middle-aged man when this first
royal Scottish romance occurs. When he returned
he built himself a castle here on the safe
north side of the Forth; if ever any place were
safe in that eleventh century. He waited here
the coming of Margaret, and she came, the first
Margaret of England.</p>

<p>It was the first year after the Conquest, and
Princess Margaret with her brother and sister
were fleeing to her mother's people in Bohemia.
They were wrecked far north in the
Firth of Forth&mdash;which thereby becomes part of
the legendary coast of Bohemia. She landed
at St. Margaret's Hope, the first bay to the
west of North Queensferry. Malcolm saw her
from his high tower&mdash;and they were married&mdash;and
they lived happily ever after, and richly
for a quarter of a century; and they live immortally
now.</p>

<p>Their history is certain, but it reads like a
romance. It may be read, very exquisitely set
forth, in "The Tides of Spring," a one-act<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
drama by Arthur Upson, the young American
poet whose sonnet on Calton Hill I have just
quoted; a poet who went to his death so tragically
and so beautifully in Lake Bemidji in
Minnesota, a few years ago.</p>

<p>The story in the play, of Malcolm and Margaret,
is all apple blossoms and spring tides;
it is very lovely. Margaret has met Malcolm
before, and destiny brings her to Scotland and
to the king. It is a beautiful beginning to a
long enduring love story that through all the
reality of history shows a tender devotion from
this stern northern king to the saintly queen
from the Saxon South.</p>

<p>They safeguarded themselves and their royal
flock in Edinburgh, but they lived in Dunfermline.
Margaret knew a richer and a more religious
life than Malcolm, and she it was who
laid the foundations of the kingdom, in court
and church. "Whatever she refused, he refused
also; whatever pleased her, he also loved,
for the love of her," says her confessor.
English Margaret, unlike the later English
Margaret of Alexander III, did not find the
North "a sad and solitary place"; and unlike
the English Margaret of James IV she was
saintly, a white pearl in this wild red time.</p>

<p>Malcolm and Margaret became the father<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
and mother of a royal brood, four kings of Scotland,
and of Queen Matilda of England&mdash;surely
Banquo saw clearly on that terrible night; his
prophecy began with a royal rush.</p>

<p>But who would not live a lovely and pleasant
life in this well-placed royal burg, serene upon
her hill? Rich green fields spread down to the
Forth, the red network of the bridge lifts itself
into view, far to the left sweeps the Firth out
to North Berwick Law and the Bass, and Edinburgh
swims in the haze against the leonine
mountain that is ever her guard.</p>

<p>The Abbey gives the town its special dignity.
There is nothing left of the church built by
Queen Margaret&mdash;where she robbed the box of
the money the king had just given at mass if
she found the poor requiring more immediate
help. But this ancient nave built by Margaret's
son David is so very ancient that one
could well spare the accurate historic knowledge
that it is a generation too late for emotion.
There are ponderous round pillars that
could have sustained all the history we require
of them, high casements, a bare triforium, altogether
a Davidic place, a simplicity, a truth
about it, that we would not dispute.</p>

<p>The new church was built a century ago over
the old, and the ancient nave is like an aisle in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
the new. Certain details, like the little Norman
doorway, once walled-up in the time of
Knox, reward us with their preserved beauty.</p>

<p>The tombs of Malcolm and Margaret are
without the wall. Malcolm perhaps is there;
they carried bodies far in those days of material
resurrection, and would have brought Malcolm
from Northumberland. But Margaret,
canonized next century, was too precious to remain
in Ultima Thule, so Spain carried her
away&mdash;and who knows where she rests?</p>

<p>But within, before the high altar&mdash;or shall
we say since this is a reformed place, before
the pulpit?&mdash;rests the body of The Bruce. It
is no doubt The Bruce. For Dunfermline was
forgotten in rebellious times, and the tombs
were undisturbed. Even in the North transept
there rest the bones of eleven kings earlier than
The Bruce.</p>

<p>Yes, it is very certain The Bruce, wrapped in
gold cloth in the thirteenth century, his heart
only missing and lying at Melrose. Scott who
was everywhere and investigating everything
saw the tomb opened and pronounced&mdash;King
Robert Bruce. One could wish the great letters
about the modern tower looking like an
electric sign, were "reformed." But here
within the quiet, to stand at the very spot where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
is the dust of so mighty a man, mighty in
valour, mighty in sovereignty&mdash;I find it a more
substantial emotion than I have felt in the Invalides.</p>

<p>Ancientry preserves its unbroken descent
outside the church. The mother of Wallace is
buried here, and the thorn he planted to mark
her grave still flourishes, to the ninth century
after.</p>

<p>The people who sit in Dunfermline town have
not too much concern for King Robert and
King Alexander. Nor do they do much sitting,
these busy industrious Dunfermliners.
They are living their own lives, and making
for themselves profit through the generosity of
a later fellow citizen.</p>

<p>Dunfermline is a center of great coal fields,
and center of the Scotch linen making. So the
town is modern, looks modern, and the people
move briskly. If they know you are a tourist
on ancient errand bent, they look curiously.
You come from so far to recapture ancient life,
when you might have so much modern life in
your own country.</p>

<p>They know what America means. For Andrew
Carnegie is their fellow citizen, or would
be had he not become an American. Seventy
years ago he was born in a cottage toward<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
which the Dunfermline folk look with the attention
we show the Abbey. And Carnegie has
not only given a library to Dunfermline&mdash;yes,
a library&mdash;Malcolm could not read Margaret's
books, but he had them richly bound and bejeweled
and kissed them in reverence of her.
But the Laird has given a technical school, and
the Pittencrieff Glen, which is a lovely pleasure
ground with the scant stones of Malcolm's palace
above, and a trust of two million and a
half dollars, which the wise town corporation
is busy utilizing for the advancement of Dunfermline
town.</p>



<h4><i>Loch Leven</i></h4>


<p>And on to Loch Leven. I cannot think that
any one can come upon this castle without emotion.
Or he should never come to Scotland.</p>

<p>It is a famous fishing lake, a peculiar kind
of trout are abundant, twenty-five thousand
taken from it each year; rather I have given
the round numbers, but an exact toll of the fish
taken is required by law, and for the past year
it was, with Scottish accuracy, something more
or something less than twenty-five thousand.
The lake is controlled altogether by an anglers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
association. No boat can row on it, no fisherman
can cast his line, but by permission.</p>

<p>There is a small shop in Edinburgh where
tickets and tackle can be taken, and much advice
from the canny Scot who keeps the shop,
and who would make your fishing expedition a
success. "I don't know what your scruples
are," he ventured, "but if ye want the Loch
Leven boatmen to be satisfied, I'd advise ye to
take wi' a bit o' Scotch. A wee bit drappie
goes a long wa."</p>

<p>"Just a wee deoch and doris!"</p>

<p>We remembered Harry Lauder, and wondered
if we could say "It's a braw bricht moon
licht nicht." Or would those redoutable boatmen
ken that we were but pretending to Scotch
and even suspect our "Scotch"?</p>

<p>They did not.</p>

<p>The Green hotel is an excellent place to stay,
kept by a Scotchman who knows that in America
every one knows every one else. We slept
in feather beds, and we inspected the collection
of "stanes," one of the best I have ever seen in
Scotland, a great variety, some of them natural
boulders, some wood with iron weights&mdash;someday
I must brave the rigours of a Scotch winter
and see them curl on Duddingston or on
Leven. And I should like to see Bob Dunbar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
of St. Paul, champion curler of America, measure
his skill against the champion of Scotland.</p>

<p>And, of course, there was talk with the Scot
host. "So ye're American. Well, maybe ye
ken a mon that lives in Minn'apolis. He's twa
sisters live here; and he's built a hoose for
them." It happened that we did ken of this
man, who came from Kinross to Minneapolis
with only his Scotch canniness, and has built
the Donaldson business into one of the great
department stores of America.</p>

<p>And next day, after we had slept on feather
beds, we had our fishing in Loch Leven, with
thousands of wild swan disputing our possession;
a big boat, with big oars, sweeps, one man
to each oar, one a loquacious fellow with no
dialect (he might as well have been English),
and the other taciturn with a dialect thick as
mud or as Lauder's. And we caught two of
the twenty-five thousand odd which were credited
to that year.</p>

<p>As the train came alongside Loch Leven on
its way to Kinross station, suddenly I felt Mary
as I never have realized her, before or since.
There across the lake lay St. Serf's isle, and
there rose the keep of the old castle. And over
that water, as plainly&mdash;more plainly, than the
fishing boats that lay at their ease&mdash;I saw her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
take boat on a still evening, May 2, 1568, at
half past seven o'clock from prison&mdash;to liberty&mdash;to
prison!</p>

<p>I was not mistaken. She who was with me
saw it, as distinctly, as vividly. Perhaps it
was that all our lives this had been to us one
of the great adventuring moments&mdash;for which
we would exchange any moment of our lives.
We were idolaters always, Mariolaters. And
now we know that places are haunted, and that
centuries are of no account; they will give up
their ghosts to those who would live in them.</p>

<p class="poem">
"Put off, put off, and row with speed,<br />
For now is the time and the hour of need,<br />
To oars, to oars, and trim the bark,<br />
Nor Scotland's queen be a warder's mark;<br />
Yon light that plays 'round the castle moat,<br />
Is only the warder's random shot;<br />
Put off, put off, and row with speed,<br />
For now is the time and the hour of need.<br />
<br />
"Those pond'rous keys shall the kelpies keep,<br />
And lodge in their caverns, so dark and deep,<br />
Nor shall Loch Leven's tower and hall<br />
Hold thee, our lovely lady, in thrall;<br />
Or be the haunts of traitors sold,<br />
While Scotland has hands and hearts so bold.<br />
Then onward, steersman, row with speed,<br />
For now is the time and the hour of need.<br />
<br />
"Hark! the alarum bell has rung,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>The warder's voice has treason sung,<br />
The echoes to the falconets roar,<br />
Chime sweetly to the dashing shore;<br />
Let tower, hall, and battlement gleam,<br />
We steer by the light of the taper's gleam,<br />
For Scotland and Mary on with speed,<br />
Now, now, is the time and the hour of need!"<br />
</p>

<p>Because of that experience, because of the
feeling I have for Queen Mary, I have never
landed upon St. Serf's island. It has happened,
quite without my making intentional
pilgrimage, that I have been in many places
where Queen Mary has been; and willingly I
have made my accidental pilgrimages of loyalty.
I have stood in the turret at Roscoff
where she landed when only five, hurried from
Scotland that she might escape sinister England;
in the chapel in Notre Dame where she
was married to the Dauphin; in the ch&acirc;teau at
Orleans where she lived with him much of that
brief happy French life she loved so dearly;
in the two small garret chambers where she
lodged in Coventry; in Hardwick Hall, where
Bess of Hardwick was her stern jailer; at Fotheringay
where nothing remains of that ensanguined
block but a low heap of stones which
the grass covers; in Peterborough where she
found her first resting place; in Westminster
her last final resting place; and in many and
many a haunted place of this Scottish land.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 346px;">
<img src="images/i262.jpg" width="346" height="600" alt="DRAWING-ROOM, LINLITHGOW PALACE, WHERE QUEEN
MARY WAS BORN." title="" />
<span class="caption">DRAWING-ROOM, LINLITHGOW PALACE, WHERE QUEEN
MARY WAS BORN.</span>
</div>

<p>And just before starting north I made a little
journey to Linlithgow which lies twenty miles
west of Edinburgh. The palace overlooks a
quiet blue loch, a blue smiling bit of water, on
which much royalty has looked forth, and on
which the eyes of Mary first looked. There, in
the unroofed palace of Linlithgow, in the
"drawing-room," in December, 1542, was born
that queen who ever since has divided the
world.</p>

<p class="poem">
"Of all the palaces so fair<br />
Built for the royal dwelling,<br />
In Scotland far beyond compare<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Linlithgow is excelling.</span><br />
And in the park in jovial June<br />
How sweet the merry linnet's tune,<br />
How blithe the blackbird's lay."<br />
</p>

<p>It was the dower-house of Scottish queens,
and hither James V brought Mary of Lorraine
after he had married her at St. Andrews. (I
wondered if there was any haunting memory of
Margaret of Denmark who sat here sewing
when the nobles raged through the palace seeking
the life of James III. Or of Margaret of
England as she sat here waiting for James IV
to return from Flodden.)</p>

<p>Of the regency of Mary of Lorraine, when
James V died and Mary was a baby, Knox
spluttered that it was "as semlye a sight (yf
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
men had eis) as to putt a sadill upoun the back
of ane unrowly kow." Knox did not pick his
language with any nicety when he said his say
of women and the monstrous regiments of them.
And to his Puritan soul there could come no
approval of the love affairs of Mary of Lorraine,
such as that one sung by the Master of
Erskine, who was slain at Pinkiecleuch&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"I go, and wait not quhair,<br />
I wander heir and thair,<br />
I weip and sichis rycht sair<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With panis smart;</span><br />
Now must I pass away, away,<br />
In wilderness and lanesome way,<br />
Alace! this woeful day<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">We suld departe."</span><br />
</p>

<p>And now there is neither Margaret nor
Mary, neither regent nor reformer, palace of
neither Linlithgow nor Leven. How the destructions
of man have thrown palaces and doctrines
open to the winds of heaven. And how
purifying this destruction. And what precious
things have passed with them, what tears of
women have been shed, and how are the mouths
of men become dust.</p>

<p>Loch Leven has one lovely gracious memory
of Mary in the days before everything was
lost. She was lodging here, and had sent for
Knox to come from Edinburgh.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>"She travailed with him earnestly for two
hours before her supper, that he would protect
the Catholic clergy from persecution." Knox
slept in the castle, but "before the sun," as he
records, he was awakened by the sound of horns
and of boats putting off to the mainland. For
the queen would go a-hawking.</p>

<p>Presently Knox was roused. The queen
would have him join her "be-west Kinross," to
continue the conversation.</p>

<p>The reformer did not rise as early as the
queen&mdash;the serenity of that righteous conscience!
He rose reluctantly at her summons.
His reforming eyes, no doubt, looked with displeasure
on the exquisite beauties of the unreformed
morning, the mists lying soft on the
Lomonds, day just emerging from night.</p>

<p>So he joined her, and they rode together, she
on her horse, he on his hackney.</p>

<p>And the morning came on, and the day was
a glory.</p>

<p>Mary warned Knox that a certain Bishop
sought to use him, and Knox afterward acknowledged
the value of her warning. She
asked him to settle a quarrel between Argyle
and his wife, her half sister, as Knox had done
before. And often no doubt she glanced at her
hawk hanging in the high Scottish sky.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>And finally she declared&mdash;"as touching our
reasoning of yesternight, I promise to do as ye
required. I shall summon the offenders and
ye shall know that I shall minister justice."</p>

<p>And the reformer, softened by the morning,
and by Mary's eyes&mdash;"I am assured then that
ye shall please God and enjoy rest and prosperity
within your realm."</p>

<p>And Knox rode off. And Mary rode hawking.</p>

<p>The time was not yet come when Mary should
say&mdash;"Yon man gar me greet and grat never
tear himself. I will see if I can gar him
greet."</p>

<p>Or, for Knox to pray&mdash;"Oh, Lord, if thy
pleasure be, purge the heart of the Queen's
Majestie from the venom of idolatry, and deliver
her from the bondage and the thralldom
of Satan."</p>


<h4><i>Perth</i></h4>

<p>Perth may be the Fair City, but it is scarce
fair among cities, and is chiefly regarded even
by itself as a point of departure, the Gate of
the Highlands. The railway platform is at
least a third of a mile long, and very bewildering
to the unsuspecting visitor who thought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
he was merely coming to the ancient Celtic
capital.</p>

<p>For, very far backward, this was the chief
city of the kingdom, before Scotland had spread
down to the Forth, and down to the Border.
Even so recently (?) as the time of James the
First it was held the fairest city in the kingdom.
But the assassination of that monarch
must have led the Jameses to seek a safer city
in which to be fair.</p>

<p>There is a touch of antiquity about the town.
One is shown the house of the Fair Maid; in
truth that being the objective of the casual
traveler signs in the street point the way. It
may or may not be. But we agreed to let Scott
decide these things and he, no doubt, chose this
house. Curfew Street that runs by, looking
like a vennel&mdash;vennel? I am certain&mdash;was inhabited
rather by lively boys, and no fair head
looked out from the high window that would
have furnished an excellent framing for the fair
face of Catherine Glover.</p>

<p>The North Inch I found to be not an island
in the Tay, but a meadow, where every possible
out-door activity takes place among the descendants
of Clans Chattan and Quhele&mdash;there
is race-course, golf links, cricket field, football,
grazing, washing. I trust the clans are some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>what
evener now in numbers, although there
were left but one Chattan to level the Quheles.
Coming from the Chattan tribe I must hope the
centuries since that strifeful day have brought
re&euml;xpansion to the Chattans.</p>

<p>Farther up the Inch, onto the Whin, the eye
looks across to Scone. The foot does not cross,
for there is nothing left of the old Abbey, not
even of the old palace where Charles II, last
king crowned in Scotland, suffered coronation&mdash;and
was instructed in the ways of well doing
according to the Covenant. Even the stone of
destiny was gone then, brought from Dunstaffnage,
and taken to Westminster.</p>

<p>There is nothing, or only stones, left of the
Blackfriar's Monastery in which James, the
poet-king, suffered death. Surely he was born
too soon. As last instead of first of the
Jameses, what might he not have done in the
ways of intelligence and beauty, as England's
king as well as Scotland's? Very beautifully
runs his picture of Lady Joanna Beaufort, seen
from a window in Windsor&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"The fairest and the freshest flower,<br />
That ever I saw before that hour,<br />
The which o' the sudden made to start<br />
The blood of my body to my heart ...<br />
Ah, sweet, are ye a worldly creature,<br />
Or heavenly thing in form of nature?"<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<span class="caption">HUNTINGTON TOWER.</span>
</div>

<p>He came back from his enforced habitation
in England accompanied by Lady Joanna as
Queen, and determined "if God gives me but
a dog's life, I will make the key keep the castle
and the brachen bush the cow." It was a dog's
death the gods gave. The nobles, the Grahams,
would not keep the castle. So in Blackfriars
the king was "mercilessly dirked to death,"
notwithstanding that Catherine Douglass&mdash;the
Douglasses were with James then&mdash;made a bar
across the door with her arm where the iron
had been sinisterly removed. A dark scene,
with "the fairest flower" looking on.</p>

<p>So, I think it not so ill, even though time
delayed over a hundred years, that John Knox
(May, 1559) should have preached such an incendiary
sermon that in three days there was
nothing left of Black or Gray friary but the
broken stones.</p>

<p>Nor is there anything left of Gowrie house,
where James VI was almost entrapped and
almost slain&mdash;"I am murdered&mdash;treason&mdash;treason";
the jail stands on its site. Huntington
Tower still stands down the Tay; and there
also James very nearly came to his death, at
the plotting of the son of that Ruthven who
killed Rizzio and forced Mary to abdicate.</p>

<p>Kinnoul Hill overlooks the town, and furnishes
a very fair view of the Fair City. No
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
doubt it was from this height that the Roman
looked down upon the Tay&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"Behold the Tiber! the vain Roman cried,<br />
Viewing the ample Tay from Baiglie's side;<br />
But where's the Scot that would the vaunt repay,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And hail the puny Tiber for the Tay?"</span><br />
</p>

<p>It is more wonderful to-day to know that salmon
weighing seventy pounds are sometimes
taken from this Tay. The river leads down
through the rich Carse of Gowrie, toward Dundee
and marmalade. Thither we shall not go;
but it shall come to us.</p>

<p>Ruskin spent his childhood in Perth and did
not like it. But Ruskin liked so little in the
world, except&mdash;"that Scottish sheaves are more
golden than are bound in other lands, and that
no harvests elsewhere visible to human eye are
so like the 'corn of heaven,' as those of Strath
Tay and Strath Earn." That is the way for
to admire, for to see; all, or nothing was Ruskin's
way.</p>

<p>Ruskin married in Perth, one of its fairest
maids, who lived on the slope of Kinnoul
Hill; and then, unmarrying, the fair lady,
looking very fair in the painted pictures, married
a painter who once was very much about
Perth.</p>

<p>Perth is also the "Muirton" of "The Bonnie<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
Brier Bush." So some have found these environs
bonny.</p>

<p>In truth it is a lovely surrounding country.
And have you not from childhood, if you read
"Macbeth" as early as did Justice Charles E.
Hughes, thought Birnam and Dunsinane the
loveliest names in the world? Six miles up the
Tay through bonny country, stands Dunsinnan
Hill; not so lovely as our Dunsinane; once it
was Dunscenanyse! But Shakespeare always
gave words their magic retouching. And once
there stood here the castle of Dunsinane where
a certain Lady walked in her sleep, and then
slept. And below, you see Birnam wood&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Till great Birnam wood</span><br />
Do come to Dunsinane."<br />
</p>

<p>To see that wood wave in the wind is fairly
eerie!</p>

<p>Dunkeld is less of a city, more of a memory,
exquisite in its beauty, lodged in a close fold
of the Highlands. And you reach it through
the station, cis-Tay, called Birnam!</p>

<p>It is a quiet peaceful place, more like a now
quiet Border town. Hither to this cathedral,
the precious remains of Saint Columba were
brought by the MacAlpine. So I suppose they
still rest here, that wandering dust, that mis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>sionary
zeal. Also, inharmony, here rest (?)
the remains of the Wolf of Badenoch, wicked
son of Robert II, and&mdash;I am certain the pun has
been ventured before&mdash;bad enough. Gavin
Douglass of the Vergilian measure was bishop
here, and Mrs. Oliphant has written stories
round about.</p>

<p class="poem">
"Cam ye by Athole, lad wi' the philabeg?"<br />
</p>

<p>We are getting into the Highlands, we are at
them, from now on nothing but philabegs, pibrochs,
pipes, tartans and heather, nothing but
the distilled essence of heather&mdash;heather ale?
the secret was lost when the Picts were conquered.</p>

<p class="dropcap">any ways lead out of Perth, but best of
these is the foot-path way, picked up
anywhere in the Highlands. By rail the
road leads down to the sea, past Glamis Castle,
built in 1500, where the room is shown in which
Duncan was murdered in 1000, although Shakespeare
says it was at Inverness; and to Kirriemuir,
if one would match the "Bonnie Brier
Bush" with "The Window in Thrums." Or
by rail the road leads to the lakes of the West,
and to the Highlands of the North.</p>

<p>For one short space I took it northward to
the Pass of Killiecrankie, almost in fear, as a
regiment of English mercenaries is said to have
been a-feared in the Forty Five, three-quarters
of a century after Killiecrankie. For here in
a last splendid moment, Graham of Claverhouse,
Viscount of Dundee, and sometime Bonnie
Dundee, was killed, the battle having gone
gloriously his way, for the glorious cause of
Stewart and <i>mon droit</i>&mdash;some say by a silver
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
bullet, the devil having charmed the leaden bullets
that were showered against his magic life;
those who say it are Whigs.</p>

<p>Always called Bonnie Dundee by those of us
who care for romance. To quote from Samuel
Crothers, "And you say they are the same? I
cannot make them seem the same. To me there
are two of them: Graham of Claverhouse,
whom I hate, and the Bonnie Dundee, whom I
love. If it's all the same to you, I think I shall
keep them separate, and go on loving and hating
as aforetime."</p>

<p>The Pass is lovely enough, on a summer
morning, with the sun shining fair on the Highlands,
the blue hills misty in the distance, the
trees thick green on both sides the bending
Garry, and not a living thing in view, nothing
which belongs to the Duke of Atholl who owns
everything hereabout, except the air and the
beauty and the memory, which I packed in my
Pilgrim's Wallet.</p>

<p>Because the Duke owns the cathedral I did
not claim any memory beside the dust of Bonnie
Dundee&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"Fling open the Westport and let me gae free."<br />
</p>

<p>And now, to a certain defeat which I suffered
near the Pass of Killiecrankie, when I "cam by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
Athole." I was without a philabeg. If I had
had it&mdash;it sounds so enhearteningly like usquebaugh&mdash;I
think my courage would have been
great enough to do the thing I had crossed over
seas to do&mdash;to walk from Blair Athole through
Glen Tilt and between the great lift of the
Cairngorms, to Braemar. I had felt that I
owed it to Scottish ancestors and to those who
had lost in the Risings.</p>

<p>I remembered that Queen Mary had longed
to be a man. When she had come into this
North to punish Huntley, so the Scottish calendar
states, "She repenteth of nothing, but
when the lords and others came in the morning
from the watch, that she was not a man to know
what life it was to lie all night in the fields, or
to walk upon the causeway with a jack and a
knapschall (helmet), a Glasgow buckler, and a
broadsword." Her father's errant soul was
hers. And once she ventured it, but in fear of
her life, when she fled from the wraith of Darnley,
to the scandalizing of the mongers, "Her
Majestie, in mennis claithes, buttit and spurrit,
departed that samin nicht of Borthwick to Dunbar,
quhairof no man knew saif my Lord Duke
and sum of his servants, wha met Her Majestie
a myll off Borthwick and conveyed her hieness
to Dunbar."</p>

<span class="caption">GLEN TILT.</span>
</div>

<p>I added another Scottish defeat. For it was
excessively warm that summer, and Scotland
can be as warm and as dry as Kansas. It is
thirty miles, the mountain way. There is no
inn. There is possibility&mdash;there is danger&mdash;of
losing the way. There are no wolves, I suppose,
and certainly no Wolf of Badenoch. But
there were the unknown terrors.</p>

<p>So we walked a certain stent into Glen Tilt,
enough to know that it is wild, gloomy, one of
the strangest wildest places, Ben-y-Gloe, the
"Mountain of the Mist," rising out of the early
morning mist, yet not so mysteriously or majestically
as the Mountain Going to the Sun.
But no valley in our Mountain West has ever
seemed more empty. And I suppose since Pictish
time this glen has been deserted. There
were deer, red deer, that thought they were free,
and who looked out of their coverts indifferently.
We had not the heart to tell them that
they belonged, body and soul, to the Duke of
Atholl. After the Porteous riots, Queen Caroline,
presiding in the place of George who was
absent in his favourite Hanover, threatened "to
turn Scotland into a hunting field." The Duke
of Argyle thereupon hinted that he would have
to "return to look after my hounds." Queen
Caroline seems sovereign to-day. And espe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>cially
on August eleventh, the day before St.
Grouse Day, there is an ominous quiet.</p>

<p>So we returned by way of Coupar Angus&mdash;meekly
remembering the proverb, "he that
maun to Coupar, maun to Coupar." Here we
changed cars, nearly losing the train, because
we were so engrossed in watching the loading
of the luggage, the Scotch porter cheering on
his assistant, "we're twa strong men, haud awa,
let's be canny." And in the great gold sunset
that was like the glory of God upon the heavenly
Highlands.</p>

<p>We came to Blairgowrie, where we heard in
the twilight on the hills above the town a bird
of magic such as I have never heard elsewhere.
Was it a nightingale, or a night lark? It sang
like these.</p>

<p>Next morning we took coach across these
great hills, by way of Glenshee, a very lovely
way of going, and not to be regretted, in its
dashing splendour of a coach and six&mdash;except
that it was not a thirty-mile walk. But it is to
be historically remembered, because it is the
way Mar's men came down to the Strath of
Tay, and brought the Rising into the Lowlands.
We would go to meet them.</p>

<p>It was a memorable day. Not even the
Simplon pass taken on a June day when the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
road ran between fresh coach-out-topping walls
of glittering snow can make one forget the road
over the Spittal of Glenshee. There were impossibly
purple mountains, indigo-deep, deeper
purple than any hills I have ever seen, so does
the ripened heather dye the distances more
deeply. There were rocky glens, great loneliness,
a mansion here and there only just on
leaving Blairgowrie, Tullyveolan, of course;
scarce a cottage even on the roadside; once a
flock of sheep, near the Spittal, being worked
by Scotch collies, with an uncanny, or, canny,
second sense to get the master's direction.
There was lunch at the Spittal, a one-time Hospice,
like that on the Simplon. And I wondered
if the song ran of this lovely little glen
set in the midst of so much primeval world&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"O wharawa got ye that auld crookit penny,<br />
For ane o' bright gowd wad ye niffer wi' me?<br />
Richt fou are baith ends o' my green silken wallet,<br />
And braw will your hame be in bonnie Glenshee.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "For a' the bricht gowd in your green silken wallet<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I never wad niffer my crookit bawbee."<br />
</p>

<p>The road at the top of the world runs
smoothly enough. But when the Devil's elbow
is reached, a tremendous and dangerous turn
in the road, every one dismounts from the
coach, and the sight of an adventurous motor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
car coming down the turn does not decrease
one's sense of peril.</p>

<span class="caption">INVERCAULD HOUSE.</span>

<h4><i>Braemar</i></h4>

<p>And then the sight of Braemar, and a consciousness
that if you are about to spend more
money at the Fife Arms or the Invercauld than
any but royalty has a right to spend&mdash;royalty
not having earned it&mdash;the adventure has been
worth it.</p>

<p>And to have forgotten but as the coach
flashes by to read the tablet&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Here Robert Louis Stevenson lived in the summer of
1881, and wrote 'Treasure Island.'"</p></div>

<p class="noidt">this is to be home again.</p>

<p>Of course our first pilgrimage was to the
Invercauld Arms, where we again set up the
standard on the braes of Mar. It was here that
Malcolm Canmore instituted the Highland
Gathering which persists to this day. And
here, under cover of the hunt, so did the loyal
Jacobites conceal their intention, the Rising of
the Fifteen was planned&mdash;and the hunters became
the hunted.</p>

<p>It was evening, it was the Highlands, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
great circle of mountains lay round about.
And if King James VIII and III had been defeated
these two hundred years, and dead a
lesser time, and our loyalty had always been
to the Prince who came rather to establish his
father than himself, the Fifteen seemed like
yesterday. In this remote high corner of the
world anything is possible, even the oblivion of
time. It seemed very vital, that faraway moment,
which in truth few persons to-day take
into reckoning; even history recks little of it.
But very near in this illusory twilight&mdash;was
that the Fiery Cross that glimmered in the
darkness?</p>

<p class="poem">
"The standard on the braes o' Mar<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is up and streaming rarely;</span><br />
The gathering pipe on Lochnagar<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is sounding loud and clearly.</span><br />
The Highlandmen frae hill and glen,<br />
In martial hue, wi' bonnets blue,<br />
Wi' belted plaids and burnished blades,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are coming late and early.</span><br />
<br />
"Wha' wadna join our noble chief,<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>Next day we met a gentleman we forever call
"The Advocate of Aberdeen." In any event
the lawyers of Aberdeen have styled themselves
"Advocates" since so addressed by King
James. We did not know that when we named
him, but we preferred it to any Sandy or
"Mac" he might legally carry. Having been
informed by him that our name was Lowland
and we were entitled to none of the thrills of
the Highlands, we failed to mount farther than
the third stage of the Morrone Hill. The wind
blew a gale from the nor'nor'west, like those
better known to us from the sou'sou'west. It
was humiliating to have the Advocate of Aberdeen
instruct us when we returned that if we
had gone on we might have proved our Highland
blood.</p>

<p>We did not attempt Ben MacDui, although
it may be approached by the ever-easy way of
pony-back, even the queen&mdash;not Mary&mdash;having
mounted it in this fashion. We were content to
master, almost master, its pronunciation according
to the pure Gaelic&mdash;Muich Dhui. And
then we learned that by more accurate and later
scientific measurement, MacDui is not the tallest
mountain in the kingdom, but Ben Nevis
out-tops it.</p>

<p>To make our peace with an almost forfeited<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
fate, we took a dander, that is, we walked back
toward Glen Tilt by the way we had not come.
There is a happy little falls a couple of miles
from the town, Corrimulzie, plunging down a
long fall through a deep narrow gorge, but very
pleasantly. We passed white milestone after
white milestone, measured in particular Scottish
accuracy&mdash;we timed ourselves to a second
and found we could measure the miles by the
numbers of our breaths. The forest is thick
and bosky, not an original forest, doubtless.
But I was reminded that Taylor, on his Pennyless
Pilgrimage came to Braemar three hundred
years ago, and wrote "as many fir trees growing
there as would serve for masts (from this
time to the end of the worlde) for all the
shippes, caracks, hoyes, galleyes, boates, drumiers,
barkes, and water-crafte, that are now, or
can be in the worlde these fourty yeeres." He
lamented the impossibility of sending them
down to tide water where they might meet their
proper fate.</p>

<p>Only once did we meet a carriage in which
we suspected that royalty, or at least ladies-in-waiting&mdash;if
Duke's wives who are royal have
such appendages&mdash;might be sitting.</p>

<p>And on to the Linn of Dee, which is truly a
marvelous place. The Advocate of Aberdeen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
when we had asked him why so many of his
townfolk came this way, explained with a sense
of possession of the greater Dee, "we like to
see what the Dee can do." Surely it can do it.
In these rock walls it has spent centuries carving
for itself fantastic ways, until not the
Dalles of the St. Croix can excel its rock-bound
fantasy. Given time, the Dee can "do" pretty
much as it pleases in granite.</p>

<p>The few miles we ventured beyond the Linn
were enough to prove that the way was long,
the wind was cold, the minstrel was infirm and
old. Had we walked all the mountain way we
should have been much in need of a "plaidie to
the angry airts." This air is very bracing.</p>

<p>But we sang many Jacobite songs in memory
of the Risings. "Wha'll be King but Charlie?"
and "Charlie is my Darling," and "Over
the sea Charlie is coming to me," and "Will ye
no come back again." And we sang with particular
satisfaction that we were not, after all,
to suffer royal wrongs&mdash;surely there is a falling
away in the far generations in the far
places, since a King's son could so adventure&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"Dark night cam' on, the tempest roar'd,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Loud o'er the hills and valleys,</span><br />

<p>On these braes of Mar, and in these hills and
beside these very streams, the Prince made his
adventure&mdash;yes, and simply because of that adventure
will be forever remembered by those
who believe in the heroic mood.</p>

<p>To leave Braemar the road leads down to Ballater,
with motor cars to take it swiftly; past
the castles of Mar old and new, where betimes
sits the present Earl of Mar, not conning Risings
but writing to the magazines his idea of a
free Scotland, which shall have its Home Rule
like Ireland&mdash;which was once Scotland&mdash;and
which may have it at the great peace; down
through an increasingly pleasant country. Balmoral
Castle looks deserted now of its queen&mdash;and
when queens desert, places are much emptier
than when kings leave. But "queen's
weather" is still possible here, even though the
castle and our way are overshadowed by Lochnagar,
on which we bestow more than passing
glance in memory of that Gordon who was Lord
Byron.</p>

<h4><i>Aberdeen</i></h4>

<p>There is no city in Scotland which seems to
me to have more personality, a more distinct
personality, than Aberdeen. It is plainly a
self-sufficient city, and both in politics and in
religion it thinks for itself, mindless if its
thinking is not that of the rest of the kingdom.</p>

<p>Its provost cannot leave its borders; once he
attended a battle, many and many a year ago,
nineteen miles from the city at Harlow, and
sad to say, he was killed. So now the provost
remains in the city, he cannot leave it more
than President can leave Republic, or Pope the
Vatican.</p>

<p>In religion, Aberdeen is strongly Episcopalian,
where it is not Catholic. In truth there
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
is a band of Catholicism running across the
country, from Aberdeen to Skye, through the
heart of the Highlands. As might be expected,
the Highlands never yielded to the reformatory
methods of John Knox, but remained of the
faith.</p>

<span class="caption">MARISCHAL COLLEGE.</span>
</div>

<p>There is no city that looks so Scottish, and
yet so different, as Aberdeen. It is a dignified
and an extraordinarily clean city. After a rain
its granite glitters as though it had been newly
cut, and to one accustomed to smoke-grimed
American cities Aberdeen looks as though it
were built this morning, when no doubt much
of this granite has a right to the hoar of antiquity.</p>

<p>Marischal College, founded by the Keiths,
who were Earl Marischals, boasts of being the
greatest granite pile in the world, after the
Escorial. Having walked a day through a circumscribed
portion of that Spanish granite, I
chose to limit my footsteps in Marischal college.
Only to verify the stone did I enter.
And there it stood, over the doorway of the
inner entrance hall, that stone which gives me
a certain ancestral right of hauteur&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
Thay half said.<br />
Quhat say thay?<br />
Lat thame say.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

<p>Scots are astonishingly fond of mottoes.
They carve them, like Orlando's verse, if not
on every tree, on every lintel and over every
fireplace; from <i>Nemo me impune lacessit</i> of
the royal thistle race, to every clan and every
cottage.</p>

<p>King's College (1495) is an older foundation
than Marischal (1593), and where once
they were rivals, since the Eighteen Sixties
they have been harmonized, and since Mr. Carnegie
gave them his benefaction, education is
free in this University of Aberdeen. King's
College, if not the next greatest granite pile,
has a stone cross, which is the typical capping
of noble edifice in Scotland; in truth it begins
at Newcastle on Tyne when one enters the English
beginning of the Border.</p>

<p>The cathedral of St. Machar's, first founded
by the saint who was a disciple of Columba,
was refounded by the saint who was David I&mdash;of
course; what a busy saint this was&mdash;and
looks the part of age, but of strength
rather than arrogance, with its low lying
towers.</p>

<p>There is an old town even in the new town,
and the contrast is sharp. If one gets lost,
turns suddenly into this old part, it is a curious
experience. The buildings look medieval,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
French provincial, and the people look strange
and foreign; also they treat you, a foreigner,
with all that curiosity, and something of that
disrespect which you, of course, deserve, having
interloped into their sanctuary. The Duke
of Cumberland lived here for six weeks before
advancing on Culloden, and while he did not
"butcher" here to deserve his name, his soldiers
left as ugly a fame behind them as Montrose's
men, what time he made bloody assault
on the city.</p>

<p>And in Broad Street may be found the house
in which George Gordon, Lord Byron, lived in
his school days. In Don Juan, he autobiographically
remembers&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"As 'Auld Lang Syne' brings Scotland one and all,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Scotch plaids, Scotch snoods, the blue hills, and clear streams</span><br />
The Dee, the Don, Balgownie's Brig's black wall,<br />
All my boy feelings, all my gentle dreams<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of what I then dreamt, clothed in their own pall</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like Banquo's offspring;&mdash;floating past me seems</span><br />
My childhood in this childishness of mine:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I care not&mdash;'tis a glimpse of 'Auld Lang Syne.'"</span><br />
</p>

<p>Aberdeen is a sea city, lying between the
mouths of the Dee and the Don. A bridge,
dating from 1320, crosses the Don, and Byron
steadfastly avoided it, lest he, a single son,
might be found thereon on the single foal of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
a mare, and the prophecy be filled, the brig fall
down.</p>

<p>One day in a small booth off Union Street I
stopped to buy strawberries&mdash;if you pick up
southern England in early May and make Inverness
in late August, you can follow red
strawberries and red poppies in the wheat all
the way from Land's End to John o' Groat's.
I asked the price of the berries and was told.
I asked again, and again. Finally, not ears
but intuition told me. It was a Scandinavian-Gaelic-English.
I remembered that in Edinburgh
I had once asked a policeman the way, and
hearing his reply I turned to my friend&mdash;"Wouldn't
you think you were in Minneapolis?"
For especially in Aberdeen you are
looking to that Norway with which Scotland
was so closely linked, as with all the Scandinavian
countries, in the early centuries, till the
Maid of Norway, granddaughter to Alexander
III died on her way to take the crown, and till
after Margaret of Denmark brought the Orkneys
and the Hebrides to James III as her
dowery.</p>

<p class="poem">
"To Norroway, to Norroway,<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p>And I remember the tragedy of that frustrated
journey&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"O forty miles off Aberdeen,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Tis fifty fathoms deep,</span><br />

</p>

<p>Remembering the sea, which I had not yet
seen, I tried to make my way down to the shore,
but Aberdeen is a sea-port, and docks instead
of shore line its sea edge. What I was seeking
was rather rocks&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"On the rocks by Aberdeen,<br />
Where the whistlin' wave had been<br />
As I wandered and at e'en<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Was eerie&mdash;"</span><br />
</p>

<p>And after a visit to the fishmarket, which is
a truly marvelous monstrous place, I set out
to find the rocks, toward the south.</p>

<p>There is never a place more rock-bound,
more broken into fantastic shapes, and worn
daily and increasingly by the waves, than this
east coast. Neither Biarritz nor Brittany nor
Nova Scotia is more broken or more thunderous
in resentment. I have not seen the Magellan
straits.</p>

<p>One is constantly conscious of fish on this
east coast. The railroads form the Great East<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
Fish route. I have been coming up in the night
from London and had to hold my breath until
we passed these swift fish trains which have
the right of way to the metropolitan market.
A little south of Aberdeen is the village of Findon;
whence finnan haddie.</p>


<h4><i>Dunnottar</i></h4>

<p>The rocks which were my goal were those
just below Stonehaven. At Stonehaven the
French had landed supplies for the Forty Five&mdash;as
from Montrose, a few miles farther down
the coast, King James had sailed after the failure
of the Fifteen. Fishing vessels lay idly
in the narrow harbour, their tall masts no doubt
come "frae Norroway o'er the faem," since
the trees on the east coast have not increased
from that day when Dr. Johnson found the
sight of a tree here equal to that of a horse in
Venice.</p>

<p>Dunnottar stands on a great crag of this
coast, against which the sea has beaten angrily
since time and the coast began, against which
it moans and whines at low tide, and then, come
high tide, rushes thunderously in to see what
havoc it can work once more.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i304.jpg" width="600" height="360" alt="DUNNOTTAR CASTLE." title="" />
<span class="caption">DUNNOTTAR CASTLE.</span>
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>
<p>Dunnottar is impregnable. I cannot believe
that sixteen inch guns&mdash;is it seventeen, now?&mdash;would
make impression on this great red crag.
I know they would; after Liege and Namur
one knows that modern guns can outlaw any
impregnability of the past. But I do not believe.</p>

<p>The road from Stonehaven runs for two miles
over level country, and then, suddenly, the edge
breaks in a sheer cliff.</p>

<p>Across a natural moat of great depth, on a
cliff crag, stands the castle. The road picks
its way down perilously; only a mule path, and
that precipitous. Then it crosses the dry bed
where once may have hung a draw bridge, and,
entering through a portcullis, it climbs to the
castle, through a winding, tortuous way, sometimes
a climb, sometimes a flight of steps, sometimes
open to the sky but ramped sternly on
either side, sometimes through stone canyons;
a place impossible to surprise. Finally you
reach the top, the sky.</p>

<p>The top is three acres large.</p>

<p>Far back, no doubt in Culdee times, a church
stood there. Because churches must be sanctuary
they took the high places; otherwise why
should one lift prayer to God when the mad
sea was continually contradicting the faith?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir William Keith, being a warrior with a
warrior's eye, looked on the place, found it
strategically good, and built a tower thereon.
He was excommunicated by the Bishop of St.
Andrew's&mdash;who did not anticipate the Lords
of the Congregation and the Covenanters. Sir
William appealed to Rome. Rome ordered the
ban removed. And ordered Sir William to
build a church on the mainland, beyond the
protestantism of the waves.</p>

<p>It began its war history early. In 1297 four
thousand English took refuge here to escape
Wallace. Nothing daunted, Wallace scaled the
cliff, entered a window&mdash;the proof is there in
the window&mdash;opened the gate, let in his men,
and slaughtered the four thousand.</p>

<p>Edward III took it, and Montrose besieged
it.</p>

<p>Then it swung back into loyal legal possession,
and experienced a bit of history worth
the telling. In 1652&mdash;Montrose had been dead
two years&mdash;the Countess Dowager had taken
into safe keeping the regalia of Scotland. The
castle was besieged by those who had killed
their king and would destroy the king's insignia.
If the castle should fall the very symbol
of the king's royalty would be melted, as
Cromwell melted the regalia of England. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
defense was not strong. At any moment it
might be forced to surrender. But the regalia
must be saved.</p>

<p>So the Lady Keith plotted. It was a woman's
plot&mdash;always there is the woman in Jacobitism.
The wife of the minister at Kinneff
paid a visit to the wife of the governor of
Dunnottar; Mrs. Grainger called on Mrs. Ogilvie.
She had been "shopping" in Stonehaven,
and was returning to Kinneff five miles down
the sea. When Mrs. Grainger left the castle
she carried with her the crown of Scotland. Sitting
on her horse she made her way through
the besieging lines, and her maid followed with
the scepter of Scotland and the sword in a bag
on her back. The English besiegers showed
every courtesy to the harmless woman&mdash;and to
the Honours of Scotland. Mrs. Grainger carefully
buried the treasure beneath the paving
of Kinneff church, and not until her death did
she betray their hiding place to her husband.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Lady Keith sent her son Sir John
to France. A little boat escaping in the night
carried him to the French vessel lying off shore,
and the Lady sent forth the rumour that Sir
John had carried the regalia to the King o'er
the water, to Charles II at Paris. It was after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
the Restoration that the aureate earth at Kinneff
was dug up. The women had saved the
Scottish crown for the rightful lawful king.</p>

<p>A dark chapter runs a quarter of a century
later. The castle was still loyal. In truth it
was always loyal except in brief usurpations, as
all this corner of Scotland was loyal and royal
and Jacobite. In 1675 in "Whig's Vault"
there lodged one hundred and sixty-seven Covenanters
as prisoners, and they lodged badly.
Many died, a few escaped, the rest were sold
as slaves. Coming on ship to New Jersey as
the property of Scott of Pitlochry, Scott and
his wife died and almost all the covenanting
slaves. Only a few saw the plantations of the
New World, and could resume the worship of
their God. The story of Dunnottar is dark.
The castle looks the dark part it played.</p>

<p>In Dunnottar churchyard on the mainland
there is a Covenanter's stone, where "Old Mortality"
was working when Scott came upon
him. The stone carries a simple stern legend
of heroism&mdash;and almost wins one to the cause.</p>

<p>And yet, there is evidence that in stern Dunnottar
life had its moments other than war and
siege. The remnants of the castle are of great
extent; bowling gallery, ballroom, state dining-room,
a library, a large chapel, speak a varied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
existence. There is a watch tower, a keep, rising
forty sheer feet above the high rock, with
ascent by a winding stair, somewhat perilous
after the centuries; but from the Watchman's
seat what a prospect, landward and seaward!
What a sense of security in the midst of peril!
And on the farther corner of the giddy height,
above the rock and above the waves dashing
far below, I found growing blue bells of Scotland.</p>

<p>There is one corner of the castle where I
fain would inhabit, the northwest corner that
looks down on the sea raging cruelly upon the
rocks that are the first line of defense against
the onslaught of the sea, and that looks far
over the North Sea; that sea which is more
mysterious to me and more lovely than the
Mediterranean; I have seen it a beautiful intense
Italian blue, with an Italian sky above it.
I have never seen it still, always surging, raging,
always cruel. Yet I should be willing to look out
on it for many unbroken days. And to hear the
somber movement of the "Keltic" sonata
played upon the rocks.</p>

<p>The Earl Marischal liked the view, whatever
his generation. The North was in his blood,
and the sea, even though he was a landsman,
spoke adventure. The Earl's bedroom is al<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>most
habitable to-day. Once it was a place of
luxury. The plaster still clings to the walls
in places, and there is a fireplace where still
one could light a fire against the chill of the
North. The date above is 1645, when Charles
was still king, and there was no threat of disloyalty.
The tablet unites the arms of the
Keiths and the Seatons, the stone divided by a
pillar surmounted by two hearts joined. The
Keith motto, <i>Veritas vincit</i>, underlines the
Keith shield; but I like better the Seaton motto&mdash;<i>Hazard
yit forvard</i>.</p>

<p>The Earl's library opens out of this. And
I doubt not it was richly stored in the days
when the last Lord Marischal won here that
mental habitude which made him equal in wit
and wisdom to Voltaire. And no doubt here
sat his mother, loyal Jacobite, steadfast Catholic,
sending her two sons forth to battle for the
lost cause of the Stewarts&mdash;never lost while
women remember&mdash;while she looked forth on
these waters and watched for the return. The
story runs in the Jacobite ballad of "Lady
Keith's Lament"&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"I may sit in my wee croo house,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At the rock and the reel fu' dreary,</span><br />
I may think on the day that is gane,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And sigh and sab till I grow weary....</span><br />

</div>

<p class="dropcap">he iron road from Aberdeen to Inverness
must follow somewhat the road
which gallant Mary took on her way to
punish Huntley. There is a bleak stern look
about this country as a whole, but here and
there stand castles, or lie low the ruins of castles,
in many a chosen place of beauty; for
harsh as were these lords, and devastating as
were their deeds, life must have had its moments
of wonder and of delight. If Malcolm
Canmore destroyed Inverness before the Twelve
Hundreds, and the fat Georges destroyed Inverugie
late in the Seventeen Hundreds, and
all through the centuries that stretched between
strong men built strongholds and stronger men
took them and made mock of them, still there
must have been gentleness and beauty. There
were women, other than Lady Macbeth; there
were young men and maidens noble or common;
and I suppose the glamour of romance,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
the reality or the illusion of love, was invented
before peace and commerce became the occupations
of men.</p>


<h4><i>Peterhead</i></h4>

<p>One brief journey I made along the bleak
coast up to the town of Peterhead, which looks
nearest to Norroway across the foam, and has
a most uncompromising aspect. Peterhead is
a penal town to-day; and it is one of a string
of fishing villages, picturesque as fishing villages
are, except to the nose, "that despised
poet of the senses"; and not picturesque to the
people, who lack the colour of fisherfolk in Brittany.
But I wished to see with mine own eyes
the ruins of Inverugie.</p>

<p>It is one of the castles belonging to the Lords
Marischal. It came to them in a curious way
of forfeiture, an abbot dispossessed or some
such thing, like Dunnottar, but without the
appeal to Rome. And one of the stones
of the castle carried the promise, and the
threat&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"As lang's this stane stands on this croft<br />
The name o' Keith shall be abaft,<br />
But when this stane begins to fa'<br />
The name o' Keith shall wear awa'."<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p>The last Lord Marischal came hither, late,
late, in the Seventeen Hundreds. He had seen
a century move through strife to peace. In
person he had taken part in the Rising of the
Fifteen, a young man, but still hereditary Lord
Marischal, and loyal to the Stewart cause. He
had taken no part in the Rising of the Forty
Five; he was not "out" on that dark night.
But the sweeping revenge of those English
times made the Keiths attaint and&mdash;the stone
dropped from its croft. The Lord Marischal
and his brother made the continent their refuge,
Paris in particular, although the activities of the
proposed restoration took their Lordships to
Madrid and Rome and Berlin and St. Petersburg.</p>

<p>The younger brother, James, was made a
Field Marshal by Catherine of Russia, and
that amorous termagant making love to him in
the natural course of proximity, he discreetly
fled, became Field Marshal for Frederick the
Great, and not marrying&mdash;whatever the romance
of the Swedish lady&mdash;he fell at the battle
of Hochkirch in 1758, and lies buried in the
<i>Garison Kirche</i> of Berlin. A statue stands in
the Hochkirch kirche, and in 1868 the King of
Prussia presented a replica to Peterhead. And
even so late as 1889, the Kaiser, remembering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
the Great King's Field Marshal, named one of
the Silesian war units, the Keith regiment.</p>

<p>There is no statue to the Lord Marischal&mdash;<i>Mar&eacute;schal
d'Ecosse</i>, always he signed himself.
He was the friend of the wittiest and wisest and
wickedest men of his time, of David Hume, and
Voltaire, and Rousseau, and Frederick the
Great. Neither did he marry. Dying at the
age of ninety-two, he was buried in Potsdam.
There is no statue to him, there or here. And
Inverugie lies in low ruins.</p>

<p>Hither he came, when attaint was lifted, late
in those tottering years. He drove out to the
castle, remembering all it had meant, the long
splendid records of the Earls Marischal, and
how the King, James III and VIII&mdash;Banquo
saw him also&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"And yet the eighth appears, who bears a glass<br />
Which shows me many more."<br />
</p>

<p>James, not pretending but claiming, landed
at Peterhead, lodged at Inverugie, summoned
the loyal and they came. The Standard was
lifted for a moment, and then fell.</p>

<p>Breaking into tears the old Lord Marischal
realized all, an epoch closed, a Scotland no
longer requiring a Marischal. He left Inverugie,
even this ruin.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>All this Northeast territory, no larger than
a county in Dakota, bears these scars of the
past.</p>

<p>At Elgin there are the ruins of a cathedral;
ruined, not by the English but by the Wolf of
Badenoch, because my Lord Bishop had given
a judgment which did not please my Lord of
Badenoch. And the Wolf, his fangs drawn,
was compelled to stand barefooted three days
before the great west gate.</p>

<p>At Canossa! Lands and seas and centuries
divide&mdash;but there is slight difference.</p>

<p>A scant mile or two to the north of Elgin lies
the ruined Spynie Castle of the Lord Bishop, a
great place for strength, with massive keep&mdash;and
fallen. "A mighty fortress is our God."
Cathedrals, castles, bishops and lords, all pass
away.</p>


<h4><i>Cawdor</i></h4>

<p>As we neared one of the last of the Northern
stations, we turned to each other and asked,
"How far is't called to Forres?" And suddenly
all was night and witch dance and omen
and foretelling. For it is here in the palace that
Banquo's ghost appeared and foretold all that
history we have been meeting as we came
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
northward. And next is the town of Nairn, which
has become something of a city since Boswell
found it "a miserable place"; it is still long
and narrow, stretching to the sea with its fisherfolk
cottages and bonneted women like the
fisher wives of Brittany; and stretching to the
Highlands at the other end, as King James
said.</p>

<p>It was here that Wordsworth heard</p>

<p class="poem">
"Yon solitary Highland lass,<br />
Reaping and singing by herself; ...<br />
Perhaps the plaintive numbers flow<br />
For old unhappy far-off things,<br />
And battles long ago....<br />
The music in my heart I bore<br />
Long after it was heard no more."<br />
</p>

<p>But one leaves the train with a curious feeling.
Of course one may be a little tired. Arm
chair travel and arm chair tragedy have their
advantages. But&mdash;Nairn is the nearest point to
the blasted heath.</p>

<p class="poem">
"Where's the place?<br />
Upon the heath,<br />
There to meet Macbeth."<br />
</p>

<p>It is not entirely necessary that one should
make Nairn and walk out to The Heath. Any
of these northern silent Scottish blasted heaths
will serve. It is as though the witches had made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
their mysterious incantations anywhere, everywhere.
And if Shakespeare was in Scotland
in 1589&mdash;as I like to think he was&mdash;it is doubtful
if he saw The Heath. Johnson told Hannah
More, so she reports, that when he and
Boswell stopped for a night at a spot where
the Weird Sisters appeared to Macbeth, they
could not sleep the night for thinking of it.
Next day they found it was not The Heath.
This one is, in all faith, apocryphal. Still, if
you come hither toward evening, when</p>

<p class="poem">
"Good things of day begin to droop and drowse"<br />
</p>

<p class="noidt">it is fearsome enough. Such heaths demand
their legend.</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"The thane of Cawdor lives</span><br />
A prosperous gentleman."<br />
</p>

<p>Not so prosperous now as when he lived in
the life. Shakespeare took liberties with the
Thane. He immortalized him into Macbeth!
And Cawdor Castle, out from Nairn a few
paces on the burn of Cawdor, might have been
the very home of Macbeth. It is pleasant, flowery,
lovely. But also, it is stern and looks like
a castle for tragedy. But not for mystery. I
did not hear a bird of prey, as some travelers
report&mdash;</p>

<p>There are iron girded doors and secret apartments;
not for Macbeth, but for Lovat. This
Lord of the Last Rising lived secretly for many
months in Cawdor while the Prince was moving
restlessly to and fro in the Islands. But the
Prince was only twenty-five, and Lord Lovat
was over eighty. I like to think he was as
young and keen to adventure as the Prince.
And I do not like to think of that beheading in

<h4><i>Inverness</i></h4>

<p>The four chief cities of Scotland are arranged
like a diamond for excursion and for
history. Always Scotland, unlike Gaul, has
been divided into four parts. Places of pilgrimage
were Scone, Dundee, Paisley, Melrose.
Places for the quartering of Montrose were
Glasgow, Perth, Aberdeen, Stirling. And now
four places are rivals; in trade somewhat, but
Glasgow leads in beauty, but Edinburgh, after
all, is unique in dignity, but Aberdeen is un<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>bending;
in the picturesque there remains Inverness.</p>

<p>The city deserves its honours. (William
Black has painted it in "Wild Eelin.") It has
a life of its own. For when I first came to
Inverness there was a cattle fair on, and sheep
from all over the kingdom, from Shropshire
and from the Cheviots, came to be judged in
Inverness; and men came with them who looked
very modern and capable and worldly and commercial.
It was all like a county fair of Iowa,
only more dignified, with no touch of sideshow.
And, of course, there is the Highland gathering
in September, which has become too much
like the sideshow, too much a show, to attract
the groundlings, and not a gathering of the
clans. Still&mdash;if one must take Scotland in a
gulp&mdash;this is a very good chance at Highland
colour and sound and remnants of valour.</p>

<p>The town itself is full of pictures. It does
not announce itself. There is a close-built part,
looking like a French provincial town, with
gabled houses, and down on the banks of the
Ness the women spread their clothes to dry as
they do on a French river bank. There is a
new cathedral, very new, with an angel at the
font we remembered William Winter had liked,
so we paid it respectful attention. There is a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
park on the Ness to the west, where many
islands and many bridges form a spot of beauty.</p>

<p>And there is Tomnahurich&mdash;The Hill of the
Fairies&mdash;a sudden steep hill-mound, where Inverness
carries its dead&mdash;like the Indians who
carried them to Indian mounds high above the
rivers of the American West. The dark yews
make it even more solemn; one wonders if the
fairies dare play in these shades. But it is a
sweetly solemn place, and we decided to care
not what Invernessians lay buried here if we
might sit on its convenient park benches and
look at far rolling Scotland and think of fairies
and of Thomas the Rimer, who, it seems,
came hither all the way from Ercildoune from
Melrose to heap this mound for his burial! The
errant Scots!</p>

<p>There remains no stone of Macbeth's Castle
to which the gentle Duncan came&mdash;"And when
goes hence?" The county buildings&mdash;and a
jail!&mdash;stand on its site, a most modern pile.
Malcolm razed that castle after he had returned
from England, and after Birnam wood had
come to Dunsinane. It was builded again; Inverness
was a vantage point. Perhaps that one
was burned by the Lord of the Isles who afterward
came to repentance and to Holyrood.
And builded again so that Huntley could defy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
Mary, and she could take the castle and order
it razed. And builded again so that Cromwell
could destroy it. And builded again as one of
the five fortresses whereby he sought to hold
Scotland "Protected." And destroyed at the
Restoration which sought to destroy all the
Protectorate had built. But builded again so
it might be destroyed by Prince Charles Edward.
No, I scarce think there is even the dust
of the castle of Macbeth left in Inverness, or
incorporated into modern Fort George. The
"knock, knock, knock," which the porter heard
at the gate, has battered down a score of ominous
strongholds.</p>

<p>But still</p>

<p class="poem">
"The castle hath a pleasant seat; the air<br />
Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself<br />
Unto our gentle senses."<br />
</p>

<p>For all the north of Scotland, away from the
east winds, is pleasant and lovely, with the mean
climate that of London, and possible in winter
and summer.</p>

<p>In the grounds there stands a statue of Flora
Macdonald looking out to the West, and carrying
the legend&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"On hills that are by right his ain<br />
He roams a lanely stranger."<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>

<p>Could legend be better chosen to compress
and carry all that story of loyalty and courage
and devotion?</p>

<p>And so we moved out to Culloden.</p>

<p>It was on a gray wind-swept afternoon that
we made our pilgrimage. There was no sense
of rain. It was a hard sky. It spread leaden
to the world.</p>

<p>We chose to walk the six mile stretch. Not
with comfort or any show of splendour, not
even with a one-horse carriage, would we approach
Culloden.</p>

<p>The road leads over lonely Drumossie moor
through a plantation of firs, to a wild and naked
spot&mdash;where all that was Scotland and nothing
else was burned out of the world by the withering
fire of Cumberland, and the remnant that
would not save itself but fought to the last was
cut to pieces by his order.</p>

<p>I do not suppose that even on a hot sweet
afternoon could any one with a drop of Scotch
blood come hither and not feel in his face the
rain and sleet of that seventeenth of April day,
1746. If one comes on that day the cairn is
hung with flowers, white roses of course, for
there are still Jacobites left in the world who
have given to no other king their allegiance.
"Pretender!" cried Lady Strange to one who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
had mis-spoken in her presence, "Pretender
and be dawmned to ye!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i332.jpg" width="600" height="379" alt="BATTLEFIELD OF CULLODEN." title="" />
<span class="caption">BATTLEFIELD OF CULLODEN.</span>
</div>

<p>No, it was not the Pass of Thermopyl&aelig;,
nor a Pickett's charge. Nor was it even
war.</p>

<p>Nevertheless it was one of the brave moments
in human history. If hopeless and even meaningless,
does not bravery give it meaning?
The Highlanders&mdash;they were the last Jacobites
left, as the army of the Butcher, Cumberland,
George Second's fat son swept northward and
stopped for their larder to be well-filled before
they went on&mdash;had had only a biscuit, the day
before! They were five thousand to the English
ten thousand.</p>

<p>At eleven in the morning the Highlanders
moved forward, the pipers playing brave music,
and they recked not that the English had the
chosen ground; theirs was not even a forlorn
hope. Not if the Macdonalds, sulky because
they were on the left when since Bannockburn
they had been on the right, had fired a shot
would the end have been different.</p>

<p>On the battlefield, looking at these mounds,
the long trench of the dead, one realizes that
Scotland lies buried here. M'Gillivray, M'Lean,
M'Laughlin, Cameron, Mackintosh, Stuart of
Appin&mdash;so many brave names.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>

<p class="poem">
"The lovely lass of Inverness,<br />

</p>

<p>The small remnant that was left, and was not
butchered by Cumberland, fled to the West.
Sometimes one could wish Prince Charles had
died at Culloden! and yet one would not spare
the wanderings, or Flora Macdonald. Thousands
of the men fled to America; thousands
of Scots in America to-day can say, "My great
grandfather fought at Culloden." Hundreds
of Scots to-day are sent "home" from America
to be educated. I have met in the magnificent
Highlands of Montana, Scotchmen, true Highlanders,
who had been sent to Edinburgh university
that they might be Scots, even though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
they carried "American" blood in their veins.</p>

<p>When Boswell and Johnson came here in
1773, twenty-seven years after the Forty Five,
they found that many of the Highlanders were
going to America, leaving the lairds and the
land. One M'Queen of Glenmorison was about
to go.</p>

<p>"Dr. Johnson said he wished M'Queen laird
of Glenmorison, and the laird to go to America.
M'Queen very generously answered he
should be sorry for it; for the laird could not
shift for himself in America as he could do."</p>

<p>Small wonder that Prince Charles, knowing
of this exodus, and believing life still held for
him its chances, its glories, away from Rome
and even if he was fifty-five, looked longingly
over the sea, in 1776, thinking that he might
lead these rebellious colonists, so many of them
of his rebellious people, and re&euml;stablish the
House of Stewart in the New World. Surely
Burr, coming with Blennerhasset, thirty years
after, had something of the Stewart in him.</p>


<h4><i>The Orkneys</i></h4>

<p>Scotland is divided by a deep geologic cleft.
Glenmore, the Great Glen, runs southwesterly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
from Inverness to Fort William and Oban, cutting
the country into two parts. One is Scotland;
the other is the West, the Highlands and
the Islands. One is known, the other unknown.
One has been prosperous, royal, noble; the
other has been wild, independent, chief and
clans holding together. To-day, if the East is
strangely quiet, the West is strangely silent.</p>

<p>In the East you know things have happened;
remnants remain, ruined castles testify; in the
West it is as though they had not happened,
those far historic things; castles are heaps of
blackened or crumbled stone; or, if they stand,
they stand like prehistoric remnants, and the
clachans are emptied; the Risings, the migrations,
the evictions, the extensions of deer forests
and sheep pastures and grouse preserves,
the poverty, yes, and the wandering spirit of
the people leading them ever afar&mdash;where always
they are Scottish down to the last drop,
always looking toward Home, but ever leaving
it empty of their presence.</p>

<p>It is a stranger land, though so lovingly familiar,
than any I have ever been in. I have
been in valleys of the Rockies which were not
so lonely as glens in Scotland. When Hood
wrote his sonnet on "Silence," beginning</p>

<p class="poem">
"There is a silence where hath been no sound,"<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p>He went on to a correction&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"But in the antique palaces where man hath been."<br />
</p>

<p>He missed the note of glens and valleys
where man has been and is not.</p>

<p>From the Great Glen, a series of lochs lying
in a geologic "fault," and connected more than
a century ago by a series of locks, excursion
may be had into remote places, so very remote
even if they lie but a half dozen miles in the
backward; the farther ones, to the Orkneys, to
John o' Groat's, to Skye, the island of mist and
of Prince Charlie and Dr. Johnson and Fiona
McLeod, and vast numbers of places known to
those who seek beauty only.</p>

<p>Three forts were built in the rebellious Seventeen
Hundreds to hold this far country. The
forts rather betray history. And they form
convenient places of departure for those who
would conquer the Highlands and the Islands
for themselves.</p>

<p>Fort George, near Inverness, is still used as
a depot for military stores and for soldiers.
Fort Augustus has been surrendered to the
Benedictines who are gradually developing
here a great monastery which in these silences
should rival the monasteries of old&mdash;if that may
be. Fort William, most strategic of all, is also
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
strategic for traveler's descent. Thus is the
iron hand that succeeded the bloody hand at
Culloden become rust.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i338.jpg" width="600" height="377" alt="THE OLD MAN OF HOY." title="" />
<span class="caption">THE OLD MAN OF HOY.</span>
</div>

<p>To the men of old the Orkneys seemed at the
back of beyond and a little farther. Yet, I
cannot think how it has reduced the distance
to a comprehensible length if farther ends of
the world and endless waters have been
reached; distance is three parts imagination
in any event. As a man thinketh so is distance.</p>

<p>The run up the coast to Scrabster, the port of
Thurso, is very much on the coast, with wild
barren land on one side, and wild waste water
on the other; with here and there a resting-place
for the eye or mind, like Skibo Castle for our
American Laird of Skibo, Dunrobin Castle for
the magnificent Sutherlands, and on a branch
line leading out to the sea the house of John
o'Groat, perhaps the best known citizen above
Land's End.</p>

<p>From Scrabster the Old Man of Hoy lifts his
hoary head over the seas, and invites to Ultima
Thule, if this be Ultima Thule. And I suppose
that ever since Agricola came up this way the
Old Man has sent forth his invitation. The Romans
did not answer it, although Tacitus wrote
about it; and it was left for much later folk to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
dispute the Picts and take the islands for themselves.</p>

<p>An archipelago of fifty-six islands lies scattered
over the water, with only half of them inhabited,
but not all the rest habitable; if, like
Sancho Panza, you are looking for an island,
you will not find the isle of heart's desire here.
The scant inhabited twenty odd are not over
filled with population; these islands are not hospitable
to large numbers, not even of their own.
They came to us through Margaret of Denmark,
queen to James III, and were confirmed when
Anne of Denmark came to be queen to James
VI.</p>

<p>The sail over the Pentland Firth may be
taken on a still day when the historic waters, as
vexed as those of the Bermoothes, lie like glass.
The rage of water, of any water, is not the frequent
mood; but always it is the memorable.
Blue above and blue below was the day of our
going, twenty miles past high "continental"
shores, like Dunnet's head, and between the outliers
of the Orcadian group, at the end of a summer
day that never ends in this North.</p>

<p>Yet I cannot think how I should ever again
approach "Mainland" and the port of Kirkwall
with such indifference to everything except the
exquisite cool softness of this Northern air of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
mid-summer, with an indolent interest in the
land ahead, hardly quickened into active interest
which is the traveler's right, when we approached
Scapa in the twilight.</p>

<p>I did remember that the Vikings were once
here as kings. And when King Haakon of Norway
was returning from the defeat at Largs in
the west where his fleet suffered the blow repeated
later against the Spanish armada, one
ship was sucked down into a whirlpool near
Stroma. And Haakon died here of a broken
heart. All these seemed like old, far-off things
that are not unhappy. Yet there was a suggestion
of fate in the place; perhaps there always
is in a Northern twilight. To approach
Kirkwall after this, will always be to remember
the Hampshire, going to its death in a water
more dangerous than that of whirling Stroma,
and Lord Kitchener going with it.</p>

<p>Kirkwall is a pleasant old town; or was, till
war made it busy and new. It lies inland a
mile or two across the isthmus, but no doubt
stretching actively down to the south pier at
Scapa during the years of the great war, when
all the British fleet hovered about.</p>

<p>The town is gray, like all Scottish towns; nature
does these things with perfect taste. And,
in the midst, man has builded for his worship<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
a church of red sandstone, the Cathedral of St.
Magnus, older and in better condition than
churches of Scotland more exposed to the
change of faith; with a long dim interior that
speaks the North, with massive Norman arches;
one wonders how the reformed faith can conduct
itself in this dim religious light.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i344.jpg" width="600" height="351" alt="EARL&#39;S PALACE, KIRKWALL." title="" />
<span class="caption">EARL&#39;S PALACE, KIRKWALL.</span>
</div>

<p>But the Earl's Palace remains a thing of
beauty. Earl Patrick builded it, the son of
Robert who was half brother to Mary. If the
palace had been built in Mary's day I should,
in truth, have lamented that she did not come
hither after the escape from Loch Leven, instead
of going to defeat at Langside. Mary
was valiant, and the stern North was, after all,
in her blood.</p>

<p>But Patrick as "jarl" came a generation
later, and he taxed the islands mercilessly to
build this very beautiful palace. The roof is
gone, but the beauty remains, oriel windows,
fireplaces, and towers and turrets. No doubt
when "the wind is blowing in turret and tree,"
Patrick's palace can be ruined enough. But on
a day when the blue sky is sufficient vaulting,
the palace is a place to dream in.</p>

<p>Over at Birsay, twenty miles across the Mainland&mdash;there
are twenty mile stretches in this
Mainland&mdash;there is another palace, built
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
by Robert, himself, who was, incidentally, Abbot
of Holyrood as well as Earl of the Orkneys.
The motto-stone declares&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">"Dominus Robertus Stuartus</span><br />
Filius Jacobi Quinti Rex Scotorum<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Hoc Opus Instruxit."</span><br />
</p>

<p>"Rex" said Robert, not "regis"; perhaps his
Latin knew no better, but his spirit knew this
was right. The nominative agreed with Robertus,
not with Jacobi. Still, the ruler of the
Orkneys was a supreme lord at this remove
from king and counselors.</p>

<p>Here and there, but only here and there
through the islands, lies traveler's lure. Motor
boats make the run for tourist pleasure, and
many of the "points of interest" can be seen
from the waters; particularly the "brochs," the
cairn-like towers of perhaps Pictish building;
and the round tower of St. Magnus on Egilsay,
which must date back very far, perhaps to the
time when Columba came hither from Ireland
and converted these people and gave them hints
of Irish building.</p>

<p>There are remnants of life earlier than Columba,
of faith earlier, though we know not the
faith. The Circle of Bogar, old gray pillar-like
stones, set in purple heather, are comparable
with Stonehenge and Locmariaqueur.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>Scott found them equal; Scott who had such an
admirable way of finding in Scotland the equal
of the world. In "The Pirate" he describes
these stones, indeed he describes these Orkneys
in this accurate guide book which is still "up
to date."</p>

<p>To the blood shed and violence of old days
has succeeded the quiet pursuit of agriculture;
and instead of the boats that used to sail to the
New World, H. B. C. boats and those to the
Plantations, and to Russia for the Northwest
Passage, and to the Arctic for the Pole, are the
quiet boats of the fisherfolk. Except&mdash;when
war fleets ride at anchor.</p>


<h4><i>The Caledonian Canal</i></h4>

<p>The Great Glen itself is a necessary journey,
even though no side trips be made. I must believe
that every one who has ever taken it and
written account, journeyed down this waterway
in a Scotch mist; which, of course, is not a
mist at all, but something finite and tangible.</p>

<p>I, myself, went my ways that way. And, of
course, those who had come north the day before
me, and those who came south the day<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
after, came through magnificent clearness, and
marvels of marvels, Ben Nevis cleared of mists
to his very crest and beyond, shining splendid
and majestic and out-topping all Scotland,
against the brilliant cloud-swept northern sky!
Frankly, I am always tempted to be suspicious
when any one tells me he has traveled the Great
Glen and seen it all.</p>

<p>The scenery on both sides is wild, desolate,
mountainous, a daring of nature. There are
sheer hillsides where all is revealed; again,
there are wooded hills where the men of the
Forty Five might be still lurking.</p>

<p>Dochfour, Ness, Oich, Lochy, are the names
of these "great lakes" that make the chain.
There is quality to their names, like Superior,
Huron, Erie, Ontario. But the Scottish chain
is sixty miles long and can be made from morning
to evening, with enough of the day left to
go through Loch Linnhe and so to Oban; as
one should add, through the St. Lawrence and
so to Quebec. Yet when one has passed from
Inverness to Oban the mind is as full, it has
come through as much contact, nay, more, as in
the journey from Duluth to Quebec.</p>

<p>There are ruined castles by the way. Urquhart,
looking very picturesque, especially if the
mist is but half come down over the world and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
the purple of the distances is of that deep royal
purple so characteristic of the water and mountain
distances of this wild west country. Yet
the sunny distances are as much a marvel of
colour in their pale blue that has so much intensity,
so much real vivacity. Purple one has
learned to associate with distance; or, since
some painter has shown us the truthful trick.
But blue, this particular Scottish blue, I have
never seen elsewhere. It is woven of mists and
sunlight in equal proportions.</p>

<p>And so, Urquhart in its ruin, standing romantically
on a fir clad promontory, is most alluring
as the boat rounds it on its early way.
I do not know anything of Urquhart. The name
rather suggests the middle name carried by a
once famous actress. Somehow I half believe
that in that castle Charlotte Corday may have
stabbed Marat. But then, facetious and unromantic,
I wonder at the baths in Urquhart in
the old days when skene dhus served in the
place of daggers.</p>

<p>There are other romantic lures in the names
which seem to have dropped so carelessly anywhere.
Inverarigaig&mdash;which sounds more musical
than it looks on the page&mdash;stands at the
head of the pass through which The Prince
came after that day at Culloden on his way to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
the West as wanderer. Far down the stretch
of water rises Mealfourvournie, a rounded
naked hill overlooking the ravine where once
the church of Cilles Christ stood; and once, full
of Mackenzies, was set on fire by the Macdonalds,
and all the Mackenzies burned. The act
is not singular among the clans. McLeod of
Dare gives it to the Macdonalds and McLeods.
And so one comes to believe the story of a traveler
coming on a Highland cottage and asking
if there were any Christians within, got
back the reply,&mdash;"no, we're all Macdonalds."
Surely Saint Columba was needed in later centuries
than the Sixth.</p>

<p>The Falls of Foyers are across the lake, surrendered
now to aluminum works. And yet
Burns wrote of them</p>

<p class="poem">
"Among the heathery hills and rugged woods<br />
The roaring Foyers pours his moving floods."<br />
</p>

<p>Christopher North wrote a better, a prose
poem, which sounds somewhat curiously in
American ears. "What a world of waters now
comes tumbling into the abyss! Niagara! hast
thou a fiercer roar? Listen&mdash;and you think
there are momentary pauses of thunder, filled
up with goblin groans! All the military music-bands
of the army of Britain would here be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
dumb as mutes&mdash;Trumpet, Cymbal and the
Great Drum!"</p>

<p>Fort Augustus closes the end of the loch, and
here the Benedictines, black-robed, move in
somber file where once the red-coated soldiers
marched.</p>

<p>Five locks raise the steamer fifty feet, into
the Highlands. And while the boat is waiting
the rise, here, as at any of the locks, there is
entertainment. Fellow travelers get out to
stretch their legs, and that is amusing enough,
tolerantly considered. There are tea houses at
every lock, many of them, sometimes charmingly
rose-embowered like the houses along the
Thames. There are pipers who march majestically
up and down, swinging their sporrans,
swaying their kilts; one is almost afraid to give
a penny.</p>

<p>And I remember at one of these pausing
places where the passengers remained on the
boat, that a very pleasing gentleman who looked
as George Washington may have looked on gala
occasions did sing for my entertainment and
that of my fellow passengers; except one fellow
American who expressed her disapproval.
Perhaps George Washington did not dress so
gaily; it was just the hat. There was a black
coat, white breeches, crimson waistcoat, blue<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
stockings, silver buckled shoes, and a cocked
hat. And this pleasing gentleman sang to a
tune that was no tune but very cheering, about
"the hat me faither wore." And he was so
doing his best, which was very good indeed, that
I was forced to get change for a sixpence&mdash;it
cannot be ethical, and certainly is not fun to
throw a little silver disk when six large coppers
may be thrown. And the American female fellow
passenger said, "Doesn't it seem as though
he could get something nearer a man's job?"
Yet he was such a pleasant person. And
they're not common to be met on the highway.</p>

<p>From Fort Augustus on there are memories
of the Risings, chiefly of Prince Charlie, in the
glorious before, in the tragic aftermath. He
came hither as conqueror, that mere stripling,
belted and plaided as a Royal Stewart, and retook
his kingdom. The coat skirts of Johnny
Cope you can still see in retreat to Inverness,
if you look well. From Gairlochy the way leads
to Glenfinnan where he raised his Standard,
and the Castle of Lochiel, ruined because of
him. And hither he came, after Culloden. At
Fort Augustus the head of Roderick Mackenzie
was presented to the Butcher as that of Prince
Charles, and near Gairlochy, and near Lochiel&mdash;"beware
of the day"&mdash;is the "cage" of Cluny<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
MacPherson where he harboured during those
days of red pursuit. And the thirty thousand
pounds are yet to be paid for betrayal.</p>

<span class="caption">INVERGARRY CASTLE.</span>
</div>

<p>Loch Oich, littlest and highest, with wooded
islands and heavily wooded shores, larches and
delicate silver birches, is the exquisite bit of
the way. And here stands Invergarry Castle,
which saw Prince Charles when first he came
gallant from the West and Moidart, and saw
him when last he came defeated to the West.</p>

<p>Laggan Avenue runs between Loch Oich and
Loch Lochy, a narrow waterway with soft fir-trees
lining the way in a most formal fashion;
it has a peculiar magic when the mist has shut
out the rounded hills of the higher background.</p>

<p>Banavie&mdash;to move according to the schedule&mdash;is
at the top of the locks, three miles of them,
Neptune's staircase, leading down to Fort William
and to the sea. The railroad is the swifter
way and breaks the journey, and passes the
ruins of Inverlochy. It is a place to which
French and Spanish merchants came in far days
of the Seven Hundreds. But better, a place
where Montrose won a victory.</p>

<p>Here took place (1645) the battle between the
Marquis of Montrose and the Marquis of Argyle,
and so splendidly that Montrose and
Charles thought the kingdom was coming back
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
to its own. Montrose had started through the
Great Glen for Inverness, but hearing that the
Campbells were massing at Inverlochy, he
turned back, and gave battle. The victory was
so tremendously with the royal Montrose that
he wrote a letter to Charles, then negotiating
with the parliamentarians, and Charles believed
so that he broke off the parleying&mdash;</p>

<p>"Give me leave, after I have reduced this
country, and conquered from Dan to Beersheba,
to say to Your Majesty, as David's general to
his master, 'Come thou thyself, lest this country
be called by my name.'"</p>

<p>In five years, the two were both beheaded,
one at Whitehall in London, the other at the
Tolbooth in Edinburgh, the Marquis sixteen
months later than the King. "To carry honour
and fidelity to the grave."</p>

<p>At Inverlochy looks down the mountain of
them all, Ben Nevis, taller than Ben Muich
Dhui, taller than Snowdon or Helvellyn. And
from its vantage point, the Observatory Tower,
one may look over all the territory in many directions
whither one proposes to go; the routes
can be planned from this top of Scotland. As
Sir Archibald Geikie mapped it in his glorified
geography&mdash;</p>

<p>"While no sound falls upon his ears, save<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
now and then a fitful moaning of the wind
among the snow-rifts of the dark precipice below,
let him try to analyze some of the chief elements
of the landscape. It is easy to recognize
the more marked heights and hollows. To the
south, away down Loch Linnhe, he can see the
hills of Mull and the Paps of Jura closing the
horizon. Westward, Loch Eil seems to lie at
his feet, winding up into the lonely mountains,
yet filled twice a day with the tides of the salt
sea. Far over the hills, beyond the head of the
loch, he looks across Arisaig, and can see the
cliffs of the Isle of Eigg and the dark peaks of
Rum, with the Atlantic gleaming below them.
Farther to the northwest the blue range of the
Coolin Hills rises along the skyline, and then,
sweeping over all the intermediate ground,
through Arisaig and Knoydart and the Clanranald
country mountain rises after mountain,
ridge beyond ridge, cut through by dark glens,
and varied here and there with the sheen of
lake and tarn. Northward runs the mysterious
straight line of the Great Glen, with its chain
of locks. Then to east and south the same billowy
sea of mountain tops stretches out as far
as eye can follow it&mdash;the hills and glens of
Lochaber, the wide green strath of Spean, the
gray corries of Glen Treig and Glen Nevis, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
distant sweep of the moors and mountains of
Brae Lyon and the Perthshire Highlands, the
spires of Glencoe, and thence again to the blue
waters of Loch Linnhe."</p>

<p>This may not be "the roof of the world," but
it is a very high gable.</p>

<small>THE WESTERN ISLES</small></h2>


<h4><i>Oban</i></h4>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 68px;">
<img src="images/letter-t.jpg" width="68" height="75" alt="T" title="T" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">here is something theatrical about
Oban, artificial, and therefore among
Scottish towns Oban is a contrast. It is
as uncovenanted as&mdash;joy! And it is very beautiful,
"the gay and generous port of Oban," as
William Winter calls it, set in its amphitheater
of high hills, and stretching about its harbour,
between confining water and hill. An embankment
holds it in, and at twilight the scimeter
drawn from the scabbard of night flashes with
light, artificial, but as wonderful at Oban as at
Monte Carlo. One is content to be, at Oban.
Quite certainly Oban has centered its share of
Scottish history and romance, history from the
time of the Northmen, romance from the time
resurrected by Scott and continued indigenously
by William Black. But in Oban and
round about Oban, one is quite content to take
that past as casually as one takes yesterday.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>

<p>It is very interesting, very fascinating; one
wakes now and then, here and there, to keen remembrance,
to a sensitiveness that so much
beauty could not be only for to-day and of
to-day, that men must have come hither to claim
it or dispute possession of it in the beginning
of time. Of course the Stewarts came out of
this Island West! But, either because one has
made a round circle of Scotland from out of
romantic Edinburgh, or because one has come
from practical Glasgow and is about to make
a round circle of Scotland, Oban has a peculiarly
satisfying and yet undemanding beauty.</p>

<p>It is set for pageantry; life is always, has
been always, a procession at Oban. If ever the
history of Scotland is set forth as pageant&mdash;I
do not know that this has ever been done, but it
should be&mdash;it should be staged at Oban, on the
esplanade.</p>

<p>Life moves swiftly through the streets and
across the waters. For it is a place that all
the world comes to, in its search for the next
beautiful place. Steamers from the Caledonian
Canal and Inverness, steamers from the Crinan
Canal and Glasgow, coaches from the near country,
railroads from the east and north, bring
the world to Oban. And from Oban boats move
out on the Firth of Lorne and the Sound of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
Mull and through the broken waters of the
Hebrides, out into the unbroken waters of the
Atlantic. People come and go, come and go.
It is not that Oban is filled with people. Very
often the inns are filled and the careless traveler
may seek eagerly if not vainly for a lodging
for the night, to find his landlady a Campbell
of the Campbells.</p>

<p>But there is seldom a feeling of too many people
in Oban. They come and go, night and
morning. They do not stay. In the evening
the esplanade may be filled and the crowd very
gala; the circle of lights marking the embankments,
steamers lying at their ease after the
day's work, looking, yes, like pirates, retired
pirates, rakish, with tapering spars and brave
red funnels, the soft plash of oars out on the
bay and the moving lights of the rowboats, with
perhaps&mdash;no quite certainly&mdash;a piper, or two or
three, dressed in tartan, more like the red and
black of the Campbells in this historic region
of Argyle, piping up bravely "The Campbells
are Coming, yoho, yoho."</p>

<p>It is lively in the evening, there is always a
touch of pageantry. Yet Oban is a very good
place in which to stay and make the little foot
excursions that penetrate only a few miles into
the circumurban territory. The most con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>strained
walker may find rich foot-interest out
of Oban; nowhere do comfort and beauty and
story combine in more continuous lure. Easy
and attainable is Dunolly Castle, much more attainable
than it was in the old days when the
Lord of the Isles made his permanent seat here,
and defied the world and the king; more attainable
now than when Scott came this way seeking
"copy" and "colour" and declaring "nothing
can be more beautifully wild than Dunolly."
To-day Dunolly is beautiful, but scarcely
wildly beautiful; that is, in comparison with
other wild castles of this wild West; and very
attainable, the walk being provided with seats
all the way, casual "rest and be thankfuls," of
the municipal corporation.</p>

<p>But beyond Dunolly, four miles of good highway,
with Loch Linnhe breaking magnificently
on the eye, and Loch Etive reaching off endlessly
into the deep purple, is Dunstaffnage,
which, before Stirling, or Perth, or Edinburgh,
was capital of Scotland and the place of destiny.
Very redoutable it sits on its high crag,
as picturesque a castle as there is in the world&mdash;and
we are in a land of castles picturesquely
set. The walls above the waters lift themselves
in lofty height, and promise to remain, with
their great thickness presented to the consum<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>ing
world. It is still towered for strength and
scope, and looks its part of royal residence.
Here was found the Stone of Destiny&mdash;after
Jacob or another had carried this Jacobite
sleeping pillow hither from Palestine. Kenneth
McAlpine, somewhat sacrilegiously, carried
the Stone away to Perth. And Edward
sacrilegiously carried it down to Westminster,
where George V sat on it, in 1911, or nearly on
it, so as to prove his destined right.</p>

<p>Bruce took the castle from the Lord of Lorne,
at what time he was taking all the castles of
Scotland. And even The Bruce in his busy
days of castle-storming, must have paused in
this height, at these bastions, to look over this
western world and decide that it was good and
should be added to his Scottish world. Across
Loch Linnhe he could see the bens of Morven
and of Appin, and up Loch Etive, Ben Cruachan&mdash;even
as you and I. The Highlands and
the Islands are still primitive, man dwindles
here, and the world becomes what it was before
the Sixth Day.</p>

<p>But The Bruce did not see these brass cannon
from a wreck of the Armada, The Bruce
lived too far before that great day to see the
coast "strewn with the ruined dream of Spain."
And he was too early for the ancient ruined<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
Gothic chapel of much austere beauty which
stands near.</p>

<p>It is from Pulpit Hill that Oban gives the best
view of all the lyric lay of this water and land
world; on a clear day when the wind is from the
west, when sunshine has been drenching the
world, and when the sun is about to sink behind
Ben More. Pulpit Hill is a wooded steep bluff
to the east of Oban, at its foot parklike drives
and forest-embowered cottages with their windows
open to the sea, with rich roses filling the
air and flaunting fuchias filling the eye. It is
an easy climb, even after a day of Scotch-seeing
in the backward of the land.</p>

<p>Here one may sit and meditate on the life
and character of David McCrae, to whom the
pulpit is dedicated. Or one may look over the
land and "soothly swear was never yet a scene
so fair." Or, to borrow again from that same
Scottish scene painter, and another scene&mdash;"One
burnished sheet of living gold."</p>

<p>The eye runs far out over the world, across
the Bay of Oban, across the Island of Kerrera,
across the Island of Mull set against the late
sky, and over to Lismore which lies shining and
tender against the deepening purple background
of Morven. The sun casts slant rays
across the land and across the bay, bathing the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
far land in tender lilac, the sea in steely blue,
while Kerrera lies in patches of dark and light,
a farmhouse sharp against a rose mist that rises
in shallow places and quickly fades, leaving all
the world purple in hue. Shepherd lads and
shepherd dogs may be seen at this last moment
preparing to watch the flocks by night, and
long horned shaggy cattle browse at peace in
the fading light. Flocks of birds fly over, starlings
in scattered black patches, sea swallows
poising for prey, and sea gulls resting on the
wave after a weary day. Everything is at
peace.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<span class="caption">KILCHURN CASTLE.</span>
</div>

<p>Two longer excursions one must make from
Oban; to Loch Awe, to Glencoe. Each is possible
in a day, and yet a night in Glencoe is
almost imperative if one would be played upon
by its full tragic compass; and a lifetime of
summers would not exhaust Loch Awe.</p>

<p>The Loch I would visit; because of its
beauty; and because of Kilchurn Castle, which
is picturesque in fact as well as in picture, on
its densely wooded island with its broken outline
lying against the farther mountain; because
of Ardchonnel Castle, ivy covered, and
"it's a far cry to Loch Awe"; because of
Fraoch-Eilean (isle of heather) which is the
island of Ossian's Hesperides; and because,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
capitally because, Innishail is the island where
Philip Gilbert Hamerton established his camp
through so many summers and through a number
of Scottish winters.</p>

<p>One must belong, oh, quite to "another generation,"
to admit any debt of instruction or
pleasure to Philip Gilbert Hamerton. I do not
think that this generation knows him, hardly as
a name. But when I was young, collegiately
young, Hamerton was an authority on life and
art, and a preceptor of beauty. And, if one
read "The Intellectual Life," then, of course,
one read the rest of him. And so, one came to
Loch Awe before one came to Loch Awe.</p>

<p>To the lake I went quite shamelessly on train.
But repenting half way, over-awed by Ben
Cruachan, as who should not be, I left the train
at the "platform" and won the memory on foot.
The mountain looks as high and as mighty as a
Rocky, and the white foaming threads of falls,
hundreds of feet high, dashed down the sides
in a true "Rocky" splendour; like those on
the Cut bank or the Piegan trails in Glacier
Park, yet not quite so high. I did not climb
Ben Cruachan to look on the Atlantic&mdash;but I
have not made my last journey to Scotland. On
foot and alone, I threaded "the dark pass of
Brandir," and felt in my blood and bone that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
something in me ancestral had been there before.
Perhaps we inherit where we hero-worship.
In any event, Sir William Wallace went
through this defile in 1300, and King Robert
Bruce in 1310, with his faithful friend Sir
James Douglass, fighting John of Lorn (the
dead are still heaped beneath these gray
cairns), and going on to take Dunstaffnage.
Sir Walter Scott came here when he sought environ
for "The Highland Widow."</p>

<p>On one side is the sheer cliff which guards
the foot of Ben Cruachan. On the other the
rapid awesome dash of the River Awe. "You
will not find a scene more impressive than the
Brandir Pass, where the black narrowing water
moves noiselessly at midnight between its barren
precipices, or ripples against them when the
wind wails through its gates of war."</p>

<p>In the Loch lies the island of Innishail, still
green, and not less solitary than when Hamerton
entertained travelers, unaware of his
identity. It still carries old gravestones, for
islands in the far days were the only safe
places, safe for the dead as for the living; war
and ravage would pass them by. Throughout
this western land you will find island graveyards,
and the procession of quiet boats carrying
the dead to their rest must have been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
a better expression than can be had by land.</p>

<p>From here one sees Ben Cruachan to advantage,
even as one saw it in 1859 with Hamerton.</p>

<p>"At this moment the picture is perfect. The
sky has become an exquisite pearly green, full
of gradations. There is only one lonely cloud,
and that has come exactly where it ought. It
has risen just beyond the summit of Cruachan
and pauses there like a golden disk behind a
saint's white head. But this cloud is rose-colour,
with a swift gradation to dark purple-gray.
Its under edge is sharply smoothed into
a clearly-cut curve by the wind; the upper edge
floats and melts away gradually in the pale
green air. The cloud is shaped rather like a
dolphin with its tail hidden behind the hill.
The sunlight on all the hill, but especially towards
the summit, has turned from mere warm
light to a delicate, definite rose-colour; the
shadows are more intensely azure, the sky of a
deeper green. The lake, which is perfectly
calm, reflects and reverberates all this magnificence.
The islands, however, are below the
level of the sunshine, and lie dark and cold, the
deep green Scotch firs on the Black Isles telling
strongly against the snows of Cruachan."</p>

<p>It was even as Hamerton had told me so long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
ago, a trifle different in July from what he saw
it in December, but equal in magnificence, and
the outlines had not changed in a half-century.</p>

<p>And so I did not hesitate to go with Hamerton
to Glencoe, lovely and lonely and most terrible
glen. There is such a thing as being
haunted, the dead do cry for revenge, the evil
that men do does live after them.</p>

<p>It is a wide valley, yet closed in by great
granite precipices, for safe guarding against betrayal.
The first section of the strath is calm
enough, human, green, habitable, with Loch
Leven, a branch of Loch Etive, sparkling in the
sun. The second wide opening is terrible as
massacre, not green, very stern, and wild as
Scottish nature, human or not, can become.
Even the little clachan of the Macdonalds seems
not to welcome the world except on suspicion.
And that murder, that assassination (February
14, 1692) when William was king&mdash;William
who might have been "great" except for Boyne
and Glencoe&mdash;still fills the memory.</p>

<p>Hamerton painted the picture&mdash;"In the vastness
of the valley, over the dim, silver stream
that flowed away into its infinite distance,
brooded a heavy cloud, stained with a crimson
hue, as if the innocent blood shed there rose
from the earth even yet, to bear witness against<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
the assassins who gave the name of Glen Coe
such power over the hearts of men. For so
long as history shall be read, and treachery
hated, that name, Glen Coe, shall thrill mankind
with undiminished horror! The story is a
century old now (1859). The human race has
heard it talked of for over a hundred years.
But the tale is as fresh in its fearful interest
as the latest murder in the newspapers."</p>

<p>Yet, a half century still later, I have heard
those who declared Glencoe lovely and not terrible.
No doubt the generation does not read
history and does not feel story.</p>

<p>We did not go on to the King's House, built
in the days of King William, when roads were
being driven through the Highlands in order
that they might be held to a doubtful Stewart
sovereignty. For we had read how Hamerton
thought it more than enough to drink a glass
here, and we doubted not he had read of the
trials of Dorothy Wordsworth, sheets that must
be dried for hours before the beds could be
made, the one egg for breakfast, and&mdash;could we
have found that china cup that Dorothy forgot?
Rather, we chose to return down the lake
side for another look at the red roofs of the
home of Lord Strathcona, that wizard of the
nineteenth century, who had left Scotland with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
only his wits and returned from America with
his millions and a title.</p>


<h4><i>Iona</i></h4>

<p>There is no pilgrimage which can be taken to
any shrine excelling pilgrimage to Iona. And
all the pilgrim way is lined with memory and
paved with beauty.</p>

<p>On almost every promontory stand ruined
castles, not so frequent as the watch towers on
the Mediterranean heights, and therefore not so
monotonous. One knows that each of these, as
of those, has had its history, and here one ponders
that history, perhaps tries to remember it,
or, tries to evoke it. Dunolly which we visited
in the day's drift from Oban stood up on the
right with the city still in view. But it is when
the Firth opens into the Sound that the glory
of the water-world of the West comes on you.</p>

<p>The Sound of Mull is, so Sir Walter has said,
"the most striking water of the Hebrides." It
is very lovely in this shell-pink light of early
morning, it could not have looked lovelier when
Sir Walter estimated it. The hills begin to
stand boldly forth, for the gray mists of the
morning are rising. It is to be a fine day,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
which here because of its exception means a
brilliant sun-stricken day, and all things clear
as geography. But, at least once, one should
see things one wishes always to keep as material
for remembrance and for imagination, not
in the mist dimly, but face to face like this. Or,
as the Maid of Lorn in Ardtornish, when she
was led</p>

<p class="poem">
"To where a turret's airy head<br />
Slender and steep and battled round,<br />
O'erlooked, dark Mull! thy mighty Sound.<br />
Where thwarting tides, with mingled roar<br />
Part thy swarth hills from Morven's shore."<br />
</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i374.jpg" width="600" height="351" alt="AROS CASTLE." title="" />
<span class="caption">AROS CASTLE.</span>
</div>

<p>On the left of Mull stands the grim Castle of
Duart on its high rock, on the right on Morven
the Castle of Ardtornish, and Aros a little
farther on, and Kinlochalive at the top of the
bay of the Loch&mdash;mighty were these lords of
the islands, and most mighty the Lord of the
Isles.</p>

<p>Perhaps&mdash;it has been suggested&mdash;Sir Walter
overstated the might of the Lord, the grandeur
of the islands, the splendour of those thirteenth
century days. It depends on what light one
views them in.</p>

<p>Tobermory is the capital of Mull, and is a
place of some resort. Like all these little capitals
it is set in the wilderness world, and what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
one would like best to do instead of sailing past
them is to stay with them and go far into the
backward. Perhaps traversing Mull as did
McLeod of Dare when he hunted so royally&mdash;and
in such a moonstruck way; or David Balfour
when he was shipwrecked and walked
through Mull; or the Pennells when they sought
to walk through and did not take pleasure in it.
It is the pilgrims who won their goal one
chooses to remember&mdash;not the defeated Pennells.
And here&mdash;I am leaving Mull and Tobermory
behind me, perhaps for always.</p>

<p>Suddenly one sweeps out into the Atlantic!
The stretch is wide, oceanic, although far and
away there are islands, black lines thickening
here and there the horizon edge. The sea is exquisitely,
deeply blue, like the Mediterranean
at its best.</p>

<p>One passes Ardnamurchan point, the most
westerly point of the mainland of Great Britain,
"Cape of the Great Seas"; how one loves the
poetic grandeur, the sufficing bigness of these
names, and the faith, and the limitations back
of them; as though there should never be a
greater world with greater seas and mountains
in the greater West. To the south the boat
passes Trehinish isles, black gems lying on the
sea.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">ENTRANCE TO FINGAL&#39;S CAVE.</span>
</div>
<p>Far out on the horizon lie Col and Tiree, low
clouds in the line. "Col," I heard the professorial
people&mdash;from Oberlin&mdash;speak the name.
"Col! So that is Col!" they said to each other,
"so that is Col off there!" "Col," I said to
myself, "so that is Col." And we all became
related through the great Doctor.</p>

<p>One is bound to Staffa, incidentally, on the
way to Iona, and for the sake of Mendelssohn.
Always afterward one is bound to Staffa because
of itself. If only one could have Staffa
for one's self. But there are always fellow
travelers, there is no inn, no habitation here,
not even a shepherd's shieling, visible from
the water. There are a few sheep, a shepherd,
and so there must be a shieling. To be
marooned here&mdash;was it here Stevenson understudied
for Bill Gunn, and "cheese, toasted
mostly"?</p>

<p>The cave is truly wonderful, a superb cathedral
nave, with dark basaltic columns lifted in
marvelous regularity, and arches lifting over
with groining the hand of God.</p>

<p class="poem">
"Nature herself it seemed would raise<br />
A minster to her Maker's praise."<br />
</p>

<p>The broken surfaces of the walls are in mosaic
with green sea grasses and gleaming<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
limpets, and the floor is a shifting thing of surging
waves. The ocean thunders through the
narrow gate as it has done since the time Staffa
began, and since Mendelssohn, a mighty organ
surge, like the "Overture to Fingal's Cave,"
and yet, more than that. To be here alone, to
be the shepherd of Staffa, and come to this
cathedral, with the might and mystery of the
night about, and the winds and the sea making
symphony&mdash;life will always hold many things
in possibility, which cannot die!</p>

<p>From the top of Staffa, if one flees the passengers
a moment, may be seen the islands lying
about whose names are romance, Trehinish, and
Inchkenneth on Mull and Skerryvore, "the
noblest of all deep sea light," a mere speck on
the far Atlantic&mdash;what vigils the man must have
in the house of light built by Stevenson's father;
and on to the far north and Skye; and to the
near south and Iona.</p>

</p>

<p>Very definite was Shakespeare about these
things. A more modern antiquarian would
have doubted, and sent us wandering from pillar
to post of royal burial places. But not the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
man who created what he declared. Icolmkill&mdash;Iona&mdash;certainly.</p>

<p>That such a little island could have had such
a large history. It is so small a place, yet a
beautiful island withal, and with its cathedral,
now alas, "restored" and "reformed," and all
its far sounding memories of Columba.</p>

<p>He came up from the South as we came down
from the North, but his voyage was across the
wide seas to unknown goals; while we have the
advantage of having come after him to Iona.
And yet, to Columba, valiant adventuring saint,
Iona nor any other place was unknown goal.
There was to him but one purpose in life, one
goal. And he found it everywhere.</p>

<p>It was a large life and simple, austere but
with unlimited horizon, that Columba lived here.
It is a small exquisite life that is lived here
to-day. Or, perhaps my belief in its proportion
and perfection came because of contact with a
certain two persons, man and woman, who had
taken this life to themselves. While being
practical in that they sold exquisite wares, in
silver and gold and brass and bronze, each
article, large or little, carrying some Ionian insignia,
still they must have a very beautiful life,
ever making things of beauty out of the historic
heritage of this island. It was a large accumu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>lation
of jeweled hints they discovered here, in
the ornamentations of the stones of Iona.
They have used them to very lovely ends.
And they have lived the life of memories and
of the keen sea air.</p>

<p>One may have forty minutes, or day after day
in Iona. And, of course, the reward and the
intimacy is in proportion. It is a quiet fragment
of land, the little village with its white-washed
cottages in prim lines, and its simple
cotters, perhaps a little more sophisticated than
those of other western islands because of their
continuing contact with a curious world; and
yet these men and women and serious children
live here the year round, and in winter there is
no world, and the Atlantic thunders on the little
land as though one beat of the wave would
carry all into the abyss, or smashes on the
rough granite coast of Mull across the strait.</p>

<p>The western shore of the island is cruel, even
on a summer day. And if the "merry men"
ran their violent ways on the shore of Mull,
there are other Merry Men just as merry, just
as lurking. As McLeod of Dare saw it&mdash;</p>

<p>"Could anything have been more beautiful
than this magnificent scene ... the wildly
rushing seas, coming thunderingly on the rocks,
or springing so high in the air that the snow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>-white
foam showed black against the glare of
the sky; the near islands gleaming with a touch
of brown on their sunward side; the Dutchman's
Cap with its long brim and conical center, and
Lunga also like a cap with a shorter brim and
a higher peak in front, becoming a trifle blue.
And then Col and Tiree lying like a pale strip
on the far horizon; while far away in the north
the mountains of Rum and Skye were faint and
spectral in the haze of sunlight. Then the wild
coast around, with its splendid masses of granite;
and its spare grass a brown-green in the
warm sun, and its bays of silver sand; and its
sea birds whiter than the clouds that came sailing
over the blue."</p>

<p>On many of these western islands, and the
northern, and it is said particularly on the far
northern Shetlands, there are some dark somber
faces remaining over from the Armada. The
sea has never been kind; it breaks the rocks, it
breaks men.</p>

<p>There are low-lying hills, the chief is Dun I,
there are pasture lands, and still there are fields
of wheat and clover. Just before he died, Columba
was carried out to see the men at work
in the fields. No doubt he lifted his eyes and
looked around, on his little island, and the great
sea, and the great world beyond. No doubt he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
wished he might live longer and labour farther.
St. Columba who carried the Gospel and his
gentle Irish gospel from the sixth century of
Ireland into the far North until it swung round
and met in Durham and York the Gospel and
the culture coming up from Rome; and that
neither so polished nor so Christian. Yes, even
Columba regretted leaving the world behind
him, though he was going to the other
world.</p>

<p>Yes, I am certain he regretted leaving the
island world behind him. Did he not sing of
his longing&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"Delightful would it be to me to be in <i>Uchd Ailiun</i><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On the pinnacle of a rock,</span><br />
That I might often see<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The face of the ocean;</span><br />
That I might hear the song of the wonderful birds,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Source of happiness;</span><br />
That I might hear the thunder of the crowding waves<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon the rocks;</span><br />
At times at work without compulsion&mdash;<br />
That would be delightful;<br />
At times plucking dulse from the rocks;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At times fishing."</span><br />
</p>

<p>Thirteen hundred years ago; and the song is
undimmed, and the world has not faded. The
Port of the Coracle on the far side is still open
to boats adventuring across pleasant or perilous
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
seas. The very rock on which Columba landed,
the traveler seeking the subtle transubstantiation
from the past may stand on. And there is
the White Beach of the Monks, where the companions
of Columba paced to and fro in those
days and in this lovely land that seems too far
away to be believed in.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i386.jpg" width="600" height="379" alt="CATHEDRAL OF IONA AND ST. MARTIN&#39;S CROSS." title="" />
<span class="caption">CATHEDRAL OF IONA AND ST. MARTIN&#39;S CROSS.</span>
</div>

<p>The entire island is the shrine of the Saint,
and not only the cathedral of Iona. In truth
this particular church dates from six hundred
years later than Columba, six hundred years
backward from us. The crosses that stand in
the cemetery of St. Oran, St. Martin's and the
Maclean, the only two left out of nearly four
hundred, cannot date much farther back than
this, or than "gentle Duncan." There is a long
line of graves, each with its aged granite slab,
of the kings, Norwegian and Irish and Scottish,
of those early centuries. I do not remember
that I saw the one that speaks of Duncan. But
I do remember that the carvings were very curious
and often very fascinating, the "pattern"
intricate and intriguing.</p>

<p>Once the cathedral was a place of magic, an
unroofed broken shrine, where the winds might
wander in search of the past, and where the
moonlight might shine through as lovely a casement,
tracery as exquisite, as at fair Melrose.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
If the generations coming six hundred years
after us are to know of St. Columba, and not to
reproach us for our co&ouml;peration with time the
vandal, these roofs, this protection, must be afforded.
Still, the gate is so close locked to-day
that even Joseph Pennell could not steal in, and
so closely watched that no black lamb or ram
or other hobgoblin could affright Miss Gertrude
White or cause her to cease loving the daring
McLeod of Dare.</p>

<p>Yet, if one resolves as did Boswell, to leave
the close inspection to Dr. Johnson, and "to
stroll among them at my ease, to take no trouble
to investigate minutely, and only receive the
general impression of solemn antiquity," one
will come upon much that is of particular impression,
like the carvings about and on the
capitals, with the early grace of the later Italians;
quite worth careful preserving. And here
is the altar, and I doubt not at this very spot&mdash;church
shrines continue in this steadfast Scotland&mdash;Columba
knelt before the God whose worship
he had brought over the seas, and was to
carry still farther over land and seas. There
may be one shrine in the Christian world more
sacred. But not more than one. Dr. Johnson
is still quite right&mdash;"The man is little to be
envied whose patriotism would not gain force<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
upon the plains of Marathon, or whose piety
would not grow warmer among the ruins of
Iona."</p>

<p>The storm did not come, although we waited
three days for it. Nothing but calm in the
island of Iona, and peace on the deep of the Atlantic;
tender dawns, still high noons, twilights
of soft visible gray that lasted over to the next
morning; a land of hushed winds and audible
sounds, the seas lying like glass.</p>

<p>Not even on a Sunday morning when in a coracle,
or some such smaller boat than one usually
cares to venture, perhaps a lug, whatever that
may be, we accompanied the clergyman to the
mainland of Mull, and watched the stern sad
faces of these far away folk as they listened to
a very simple sermon of an old simple story. I
remembered that at Earraid, Robert Louis
Stevenson had been interested in the religious
services held for the workmen who were cutting
stone for a lighthouse building by Thomas
Stevenson. From these people religion will go
very late, if at all. Surely men and women need
what Columba brought hither, now as ever.</p>

<p>And because of David Balfour I walked a
little way into Mull, which still must look as he
saw it, for except for the roadway it looked as
though I were the first who had ever ventured<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
that way since time and these rough granite
heaps began.</p>

love is maddening, should lead to massacre by
those whose love is all in all.</p>

<p>I cannot remember when I did not know "The
Lady of the Lake"&mdash;which, of course, is the
Trossachs. It is as though I knew it when I
first knew speech, lisped in numbers and the
numbers came. It was the first grown-up book
I ever owned, and I own the copy yet. It is not
a first edition, this my first and only edition.
I presume that in those far away days when it
was given to me, "a Christmas gift"&mdash;I always
chose to receive it from my Scottish grandmother,
though she had been dead thirty years
before I came&mdash;I might have had a first edition
for a song; but the preciousness of first editions
had not yet become a fetich. Since then I have
looked with respect and affection on that impress
of "1810." I have never looked on it with
longing. So much better, that first edition of
mine, an ordinary sage-green cloth-bound book,
with ornamental black and gold title, such as
the inartistic Eighties sent forth; I do like to
note that the year of its imprint is the year of
my possession. It has not even a gilt edge, I
am pleased to state. The paper is creamy, the
ink is not always clear. And because it went
through one fire and flood, the pages have little
brown ripples, magic marginal notes. There is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
not a penciled margin in the whole volume.
That, in a book owned by one who always reads
with a pencil in hand, is beyond understanding!
And yet it was many and many a year ago, in
a kingdom by the sea. Memory was tremendously
active then, not quite the memory of a
Macaulay, but still one reading, or at least one
and a half, was sufficient to thrust the rimes
of these two-edged couplets into unsurrendering
possession. Criticism was in abeyance;
there is not even a mark among the notes. I
cannot be certain that I read them. Who reads
notes at the age of eight?</p>

<p>I remember how my acquaintance began with
"The Lady of the Lake," even before I read it.
In those days there was little literature for
children, and there was prejudice against that
which was provided. There was especial prejudice
in my own household. I think my teacher
in school may have shared it. If he were an
adult he would read, ostensibly to us, but for
himself, something he could tolerate. Yes, it
was he; an exception in those days, for in the
public schools men seldom taught in "the
grades."</p>

<p>He must have been a young man, not more
than nineteen or twenty, waiting to mature in
his profession. And Scotch, as I think it now;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
not only because his name was Kennedy, but
because of his Highland dark eyes and hair, and
because of certain uncanny skill in mathematics&mdash;as
I thought who had not even a moiety&mdash;and
because, oh, very much because, of the
splendid tussle he had&mdash;tulzie! that's the word&mdash;a
very battle royal to my small terrified fascinated
vision, there on the school-room floor,
with the two Dempsey boys, who were much
older than the rest of us; they must have been
as old as fourteen! One merited the punishment
and was getting it. The other, with clan
loyalty, came to his rescue. And the Highlander,
white to the lips, and eyes black-and-fire,
handled them both.</p>

<p>Oh, it was royal understudy to the combat at
Coilantogle ford&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"Ill fared it then with Roderick Dhu<br />
When on the field his targe he threw."<br />
</p>


<h4><i>The Trossachs</i></h4>

<p>To write a guide to the Trossachs&mdash;that has
been done and done more than once; done with
much minuti&aelig;, with mathematics, with measurement;
to-day it is possible to follow the stag at
eve, and all the rest of it, in all its footsteps;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
to follow much more accurately than did even
Sir Walter; to follow vastly more accurately
than did James Fitz James.</p>

<p>For, in the first place, the world is not so
stupendous a place as it was in the days of
Fitz James, or of Sir Walter. The Rockies and
the Andes have been sighted, if not charted, and
beside them the Grampians look low enough.
Yet, fortunately, the situation can never be "beside
them." The most remembering traveler
has crossed the seas and buried his megalomanian
American memories, let it be hoped, in
the depths of the Atlantic. Neither Rockies
nor Andes carry so far or so rich memories.
Sir Walter has never projected an imaginary
Roderick Dhu or a King errant into any of the
majesty or loveliness of those empty lakes and
mountains. I can imagine in what spirit the
Pennells came to Loch Lomond and declared
that it "looked like any other lake." Dr. Johnson
was quite right, sir. "Water is the same
everywhere," to those who think water is water.</p>

<p>Of course the traveler should not come upon
the land by way of Lomond. Fitz James came
from Stirling. He came to subdue the Highlands.
They were seething in revolt&mdash;for no
other reason than that Highlanders so long as
they were Highlanders had to seethe and revolt.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
And if we would subdue the Highlands or have
them subdue us, we must follow the silver horn
of the Knight of Snowdoun when he rode out
of Stirling; to subdue, yes, and to adventure.</p>

</div>

<p>Yet perhaps it is better to have possessed
Scotland, en tour, and to go back to Stirling with
Fitz James, as a captive, but bearing the golden
ring&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"Ellen, thy hand&mdash;the ring is thine,<br />
Each guard and usher knows the sign."<br />
</p>

<p>So one leaves Glasgow, the unromantic,
threading through its miles of prosperity and
unbeauty, passing Dumbarton where Wallace
was prisoner, passing the river Leven, which
ought to interest us, for once its "pure stream"
on his own confession laved the "youthful
limbs" of Tobias Smollett, until the open country
is reached and Loch Lomond swims into
sight.</p>

<p class="poem">
"By yon bonnie banks, and by yon bonnie braes<br />
Where the sun shines bright on Loch Lomond,<br />
There me and my true love spent mony happy days,<br />
On the bonnie bonnie banks of Loch Lomond."<br />
</p>

<p>No, the Pennells might criticize "me and my
true love." As for us, we mean to be romantic
and sentimental and unashamed and ungrammatical.
And spend mony days; Harry Lauder
would spell and spend it, "money."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>

<p>The lake opens wide and free in the lowland
country of Balloch. At the left lies Glenfruin,
the Glen of Wailing, where took place the terrible
clan battle between the MacGregors and
Colquhouns, where the MacGregors were victorious.
But as Scott wrote, "the consequences
of the battle of Glenfruin were very calamitous
to the family of MacGregor." Sixty widows
of the Colquhouns rode to Stirling each on a
white palfrey, a "choir of mourning dames."
James VI, that most moral monarch, let loose
his judicious wrath, the very name of the clan
was proscribed, fire and sword pursued the
MacGregors. The Highlanders are dauntless.
There still exist MacGregors and with the MacGregor
spirit. And who that heard the Glasgow
choir sing the superb "MacGregors Gathering"&mdash;Thain'
a Grigalach&mdash;but will gather at
the cry, "The MacGregor is come!"</p>

<p class="poem">
"The moon's on the lake, and the mist's on the brae,<br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Gather, gather, gather.</span><br />

</p>

<p>There are twenty-four islands marooned in
this part of the lake; for according to the old
legend, one of these was a floating island and
so to chain one they chained all. The first
island is Inch Murrin, at which I looked with
due respect, for it is a deer park of the present
Duke of Montrose. I know not if he is descended
from The Montrose, or from Malcolm
Graeme and Fair Ellen, but let us believe it; it
does not do to smile at the claims of long descent
in this persisting Scotland. The Duke
lives in Buchanan Castle, near the lake. Also
he owns Ben Lomond. Also&mdash;I read it in
"More Leaves" of Queen Victoria's Journal&mdash;"Duke
of Montrose to whom half of Loch
Lomond belongs."</p>

<p>It was here that Dorothy Wordsworth looked
and recorded, "It is an outlandish scene; we
might have believed ourselves in North America."
And so, I knew the Lomond country for
my own.</p>

<p>The steep, steep sides of Ben Lomond are in
view at the top of the Loch, but the ballad may
well have contented itself with the sides. For<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
I know one traveler who wished to be loyal to
the Ben, and having seen it in 1889, and not seen
it for the thick Scotch mist, returned again in
1911, and had her only day of rain in sailing
across Loch Lomond. The ballad turned into
a coronach&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"But the broken heart kens nae second spring<br />
Though resigned we may be while we're greetin'.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ye'll tak the highway and I'll tak the low way."</span><br />
</p>

<p>It is all MacGregor country, that is to say Rob
Roy country. We are bound for Inversnaid, so
was he. All about Lomond he had his ways,
Rob Roy's prison, Rob Roy's cave, Rob Roy's
grave, and all. And though there are other
claims hereabout, and although Robert Bruce
himself preceded Robert Roy in the cave, such
is the power of the Wizard that it is the later
Robert one permits to inhabit these places.</p>

<p>We remembered that Queen Victoria had preferred
the roads to the steamer. So we left the
boat at Rowardennan pier. Not to walk the
pleasant ambling highways, that by some good
public fortune run near the "bonny bonny
banks," and, in spite of the Duke of Montrose,
make the lake belong to us, to whom, of course,
it does belong, but to walk to the top of the
Ben.</p>

<p>The path, if one keeps the path, and he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
should, is safe, the gradation easy; an American
is like to smile at the claims of long ascent
of a mountain which is but 3192 feet from the
sea to top. But let one wander ever little from
the path, attempt to make a new and direct descent,
and let one of those mists which hang so
near a Scotch day actually descend upon the
top of the Ben&mdash;it is not the mildest sensation
to find one's foot poised just at the edge of a
precipice. It is not well to defy these three
thousand feet because one has climbed higher
heights. Ben Lomond can do its bit. And it
can furnish a panorama which the taller Ben
Nevis cannot rival, cannot equal. The Castle
Rocks of Stirling and of Edinburgh, on a clean
clear day; nearer, Ben Ledi and Ben Venue,
names to thrill a far remembrance; Ben Cruachan,
bringing the Mull country from near remembrance.
And farther across, pale but apparent,
the mountains of Ireland. A marvel of
vision.</p>

<p>At Inversnaid one is again with Dorothy
Wordsworth. It was here or hereabouts that
William dropped the package of lunch in the
water. So like William! I wonder Dorothy let
him carry it. It was here William saw the
Highland Girl, and wrote those lovely lines of
her&mdash;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p>

<p class="poem">
"Now thanks to Heaven! that of its grace<br />
Hath led me to this lonely place.<br />
Joy have I had; and going hence<br />
I bear away my recompense.<br />
In spots like these it is we prize<br />
Our memory; feel that she hath eyes....<br />
For I, methinks, till I grow old,<br />
As fair before me shall behold,<br />
As I do now, the cabin small,<br />
The lake, the bay, the waterfall;<br />
And thee, the spirit of them all!"<br />
</p>

<p>And now one really begins to thrill. One is
really going to Loch Katrine, to the Trossachs.
The road is preferable, five miles of foot-pleasure,
as against the filled coaches with perhaps
"gallant grays," and certainly fellow travelers
who quote and misquote the lines. No, it shall
be on foot, up through the steep glen of Arklet
water, out on the high open moor where the
Highland cattle browse, with Ben Voirlich constantly
in view, and Ben Venue coming even to
meet us; with William and Dorothy Wordsworth
and Coleridge walking beside us all the
way. (Dorothy always called it "Ketterine,"
but then, she came hither seven years before
"The Lady" was published.)</p>

<p>The old Highland fort was a perplexity to
the Wordsworths. William thought it a hospice
like those he had seen in Switzerland, and
even later when told it was a fort Dorothy did<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
not quite believe. It was built at the time of
the Fifteen to keep caterans&mdash;of which Rob Roy
was one&mdash;in subjection. And the American
looks with interest because here, in his youth&mdash;which
was all he ever had in truth&mdash;General
Wolfe, who fell on the Heights of Abraham but
won Quebec, commanded the fort of this Highland
height. I could but wonder how the
French travelers who throng these Scotch highways
feel when they remember this victor over
Montcalm. Now that they have fought together
"somewhere in France," no doubt they
feel no more keenly than an Englishman at
Bannockburn.</p>

<p>There is not too much lure to keep one's mind
and one's feet from Loch Katrine. There was
a piper on the way, tall and kilted in the tartan
of the MacGregor. (Helen MacGregor, wife
of Rob Roy, was born at Loch Arklet, and across
the hill in Glengyle Rob Roy was born, conveniently.)
The piper piped most valiantly.
I should like to have set him a "blawin'" o' the
pipes with our piper on the Caledonian loch,
something like the tilt which Alan Breck had
with Robinoig, son of Rob Roy.</p>

<p>The road drops down to Stronachlachar.
Through the hill defile one catches the gleam,
and quickly "the sheet of burnished gold" rolls
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
before the eye. It is more splendid than when
Dorothy Wordsworth viewed it, "the whole lake
appeared a solitude, neither boat, islands, nor
houses, no grandeur in the hills, nor any loveliness
on the shores." Poor Dorothy! She
was hungry and tired, and did not know where
she should lay her head. Later, next day, at
the farther end, she loved it, "the perfection
of loveliness and beauty."</p>

<span class="caption">LOCH KATRINE.</span>
</div>

<p>As for us, it was early morning, we had
breakfasted, fate could not harm us, and we
knew our way. We were approaching it from
the direction opposite to Majesty, the soft gray
clouded stillness, early out of the morning
world. But Scott had seen this picture also&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"The summer's dawn reflected hue<br />
To purple changed Loch Katrine blue;<br />
Mildly and soft the western breeze<br />
Just kissed the lake, just stirr'd the trees,<br />
And the pleased lake, like maiden coy<br />
Trembled but dimpled not for joy;<br />
The mountain shadows on her breast<br />
Were neither broken nor at rest;<br />
In bright uncertainty they lie,<br />
Like future joys to Fancy's eye.<br />
The water-lily to the light<br />
Her chalice rear'd of silver bright;<br />
The doe awoke and to the lawn<br />
Begemm'd with dewdrops, led her fawn.<br />
The gray mist left the mountain side,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>The torrent show'd its glistening pride,<br />
Invisible in flecked sky,<br />
The lark sent down her revelry;<br />
The black-bird and the speckled thrush<br />
Good morrow gave from brake and bush;<br />
In answer coo'd the cushat dove,<br />
Her notes of peace, and rest, and love."<br />
</p>

<p>Here we hit upon a device to possess Loch
Katrine, both "going and coming," to see the
lake at dawn, simply as beauty, and then to come
upon it as came Fitz James. With a glass of
milk for fast-breaking&mdash;we had had a substantial
breakfast at Inversnaid, and this glass was
but for auld lang syne, a pledge of my companion
to her early memories&mdash;we set out for "far
Loch Ard or Aberfoyle."</p>

<p>I think had we known how very modern is
this way which curves about the west side of
Katrine we might have shunned it. Certain the
stag would have done it. He did, you remember;
refusing to charge upon Ben Venue, and
thus avoiding the future site of the Water
Works of the Corporation of the City of Glasgow.
Perhaps Glasgow is the best equipped
municipality in the world. Yet, what city but
Glasgow would have tapped Loch Katrine to
furnish water for Glaswegians!</p>

<p>Our road ran in the deep defile that lies between
the two great bens, Lomond (3192) and
Venue (2393). The top of Lomond was clear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
in the increasing sunlight, but mists still skirted
his feet; while Venue was mist-clad from base
to summit, the thin white veils tearing every
now and then, as they swayed against the pine
trees jagged tops, and lifting and then settling
again.</p>

<p>And soon, we were at "far Loch Ard." It is
a lovely little bit of water; we wondered why
the stag was not tempted to turn aside hither&mdash;but
then, we remembered, the stag did know,
did save himself. Fishermen were out in their
boats, and altogether we decided that if the stag
did not come here we should, in the distant time
when we should spend a summer in this Highland
peace.</p>

<p>Ard is little, but a large-in-little, a one-act
play to Lomond's big drama. We chose our
"seat," and we hoped that the owner of The
Glashart would be gracious when we sent him
word of his eviction. Glashart is a short way
above the pass of Aberfoyle where, to our pleasure,
the troops of Cromwell were defeated by
Graham of Duchray.</p>

<p>But this time, after twelve miles of walk,
come noontide and a keen appetite, like the stag
who</p>

<p class="poem">
"pondered refuge from his toil"<br />
</p>

<p class="noidt">we were content to house ourselves in the hotel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
at Aberfoyle. We chose the one called "Baillie
Nicol Jarvie," because this is all Rob Roy
country. In truth we felt at home with the
Baillie, and with the Forth flowing in front of
the town, and the old clachan of Aberfoyle
marked by a few stones.</p>

<p>In the late afternoon of this already full day
we found there was a coach leaving for Lake
Menteith which would return in the late twilight,
too late for dinner, but Baillie Nicol was
kind and we could have supper on our return.
So we were off to Menteith, and to an old
memory, reaching back to the daughter of
James Fitz James. But at this far distance
she seemed to belong to an older day.</p>

<p>Menteith is a little lake, a fragment of the
abundant blue of Scotland's waters, and it is
surrounded by hills that are heather clad; only
the southern shore is wooded. Near the southern
shore lies anchored the Island of Inchmahone&mdash;isle
of rest&mdash;where once stood a priory,
and now only a few arches keep the shadowy
memory in their green covert. The stones of
the dead lie about, for the Isle of Rest was an
island of burial.</p>

<p>Hither came Mary Queen of Scots, when she
was five years old, here for an island of refuge,
since the defeat at Pinkie meant that Henry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
VIII was nearer and nearer the little life that
stood between him and Scotland's throne&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"O ye mariners, mariners, mariners,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That sail upon the sea,</span><br />
Let not my father nor mother to wit,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The death that I maun die!"</span><br />
</p>

<p>She came with her four Maries, and together
they went to France, together they made merry
and made love at the French court, and, all unscathed,
they returned fifteen years later&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"Yestreen the queen had four Maries,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To-night she'll hae but three;</span><br />
There was Marie Seton, and Marie Beatoun,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Marie Carmichael and me&mdash;"</span><br />
</p>

<p>It was as though she were lost from the world,
as we went back in the dimming day; almost
the only time I have ever lost her since historic
memories came to be my own personal memories.
And yet, I knew I should find her again.
Mary is one of the women who do not go into
exile once they have made harbour in the affections.</p>

<p>Next day, half by a hill-road and half by a
foot-path, with mountains whose names were
poems evoking the one poem of the region, with
the far view, and with birches closing in the
highway now and then, and now and then opening
into a near-far view of glen and stream and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
strath and path, we came to&mdash;The Trossachs.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i414.jpg" width="600" height="382" alt="THE BRIG O&#39; TURK." title="" />
<span class="caption">THE BRIG O&#39; TURK.</span>
</div>

<p>It is a walk of perhaps eight miles through a
charming memory-haunted land, lovely certainly,
lonely; there were few people to be met
with, but there was no sense of desertion. It
was a day of quick clouds, rushing across a
deep blue, compact white clouds which say nothing
of rain, and very vivid air, the surfaces and
the shadows being closely defined. The birch
leaves played gleefully over the path as we left
the highway, and that sweet shrewd scent of the
birch leaf, as I "pu'd a birk" now and then,
completed the thrill, the ecstasy&mdash;if one may be
permitted the extravagance.</p>

<p class="poem">
"But ere the Brig o' Turk was won<br />
The headmost horseman rode alone,<br />
Alone, but with unbated zeal&mdash;"<br />
</p>

<p>Here I should take up the thread of the old
poem and weave it entire. But first because I
had come adventuring, even like the Gudeman
o' Ballengeich, and taking my chances as they
came along, and meeting no Highland girl and
no Fair Ellen, I did seek out lodgings in one
of the cottages which cluster about the foot of
Glen Finglas, typical Highland cottages. Not
the kind, I regret and do not regret, which
Dorothy Wordsworth describes with such triumph,
where William and Dorothy and Coleridge
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
put up&mdash;"we caroused our cups of coffee,
laughing like children," over the adventure; but
still a cottage, with a single bed room. These
cottages, no doubt because artists now and then
inhabit them and because all the world passes
by and because they are on Montrose property,
are what the artist and the poet mean by a cottage,
low-browed, of field stone, and rose-entwined.</p>

<p>The hurried traveler with no time to spare
and no comforts, lodges at the Trossachs hotel,
which aspires to look like a Lady-of-the-Lake
Abbotsford, and is, in truth, of an awesome
splendour like some Del Monte or Ponce de
Leon.</p>

<p>There is a parish church&mdash;I heard the bell far
off in the woods&mdash;near the hotel, but standing
mid</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">"the copsewood gray</span><br />
That waved and wept on Loch Achray."<br />
</p>

<p>It waved gently, and wept not at all that
peaceful Sunday morning when we made our
way by path and strath into the dell of peace.
The people coming from the countryside repossess
their own, and of course the tourists are
not in the church, or if there, with a subdued
quality. The coaches do not run, and there fell
a peace over all the too well known, too much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
trodden land, which restored it to the century
in which it truly belongs.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 411px;">
<img src="images/i420.jpg" width="411" height="600" alt="The Trossachs" title="" />
<span class="caption1">The Trossachs</span>
</div>

<p>In the late afternoon, under that matchless
sky which the wind had swept clear of even
rapid clouds&mdash;we were glad we could match it
by no other Scottish sky, and only by the sky
which shone down when we first came to the
Lake, that &aelig;on ago&mdash;and by the scant two
miles that lie between the Brig and the Lake,
"stepping westward," we followed the far
memory till it was present.</p>

<p>The road leads through the forest beautifully,
peacefully. If on that early September day no
birds sang, still one missed nothing, not even
the horn of the Knight of Snowdoun. The
paths twine and retwine, through this bosky
birchen wood, with heather purple, and knee
deep on either side, and through the trees swift
glimpses of the storied mountains.</p>

<p>Suddenly the way changes, the ground
breaks, rocks heap themselves, a gorge appears,&mdash;it
is the very place!</p>

<p class="poem">
"Dashing down a darksome glen,<br />
Soon lost to hound and hunter's ken,<br />
In the deep Trossachs' wildest nook<br />
His solitary refuge took."<br />
</p>

<p>I can never forget the thrill I had in the old
schoolroom when Mr. Kennedy first read the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
story and I knew that the stag had escaped. I
felt even more certain of it in this wild glen.
Surely he must be in there still. And so I refused
to go and find him.</p>

<p>I could not discover where fell the gallant
gray. I mean I was without guide and could
map my own geography out of my own more
certain knowledge. So I chose a lovely green
spot&mdash;notwithstanding my remembrance of
"stumbling in the rugged dell"&mdash;encircled with
oak and birch, the shadows lying athwart it as
they would write the legend.</p>

<p class="poem">
"Woe worth the chase, woe worth the day,<br />
That costs thy life, my gallant gray."<br />
</p>

<p>And then, by a very pleasant path, instead
of the tortuous ladderlike way which James
Fitz James was forced to take, I came again to
The Lake, splendid in the evening as it had
been mysterious in the morning.</p>

<p class="poem">
"The western waves of ebbing day<br />
Roll'd o'er the glen their level way;<br />
Each purple peak, each flinty spire,<br />
Was bathed in floods of living fire.<br />
But not a setting beam could glow<br />
Within the dark ravine below,<br />
Where twined the path in shadow hid,<br />
Round many a rocky pyramid,<br />
Shooting abruptly from the dell<br />
Its thunder-splintered pinnacle."<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span></p>

<p>No shallop set out when I raised my imaginary
horn and blew my imaginary salute to the
lovely isle. There were no boats to hire, on
this Sunday, and I was not Malcolm Gr&aelig;me
to swim the space. But there it lay, bosky and
beautiful, a green bit of peace in a blue world.
Nothing could rob me of my memory of Loch
Katrine, not even the very lake itself.</p>


<h4><i>Stirling</i></h4>

<p>Stirling stands up boldly&mdash;in the midst of
Scotland.</p>

<p>That is the feeling I had in coming on it by
train from the West. Highlanders coming on
it from the North, English coming on it from
the South, must have seen even more conclusively
that Stirling rises out of the midst of
Scotland.</p>

<p>I should have preferred to approach it on
foot. But then, this is the only conquering way
in which to make one's descent on any corner
of the world one seeks to possess; either on
one's own valiant two feet or on the resounding
four feet of a battle charger. Alas, to-day
one does neither. But&mdash;there lies Stirling rising
from the water-swept plain, through the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
gray of a Scotch morning, entirely worthy of
being "taken," and looking completely the part
it has played in Scottish history.</p>

<p>Scotland is curiously provided with these natural
forts, the Rocks of Edinburgh and Dumbarton
and Stirling. They have risen out of
the plain, for the defense and the contention of
man. And because Stirling lies, between East
and West, between North and South, it has
looked down on more history, seen more armies
advance and retreat than&mdash;any other one place
in the world?</p>

<p>Standing upon its wind-swept battlements&mdash;I
can never think that the wind dies down on
the heights of Stirling&mdash;one looks upon the
panorama of Scottish history. The Lomonds
lie blue and far to the east, the Grampians gray
and stalwart to the north, and on the west the
peaks of the Highlands, Ben Lomond and all the
hills that rampart "The Lady of the Lake."
All around the sky were ramparts of low-lying
clouds, lifting themselves here and there at the
corners of the world into splendid impregnable
bastions. Stirling looks a part of this ground
plan, of this sky battlement.</p>

<p>Soldiers, from yonder heights!&mdash;and you
know the rest. From this height you who are
far removed from those our wars, a mere hu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>man
speck in the twentieth century look down
on seven battlefields. Did Pharaoh see more,
or as much, from Cheops? The long list runs
through a thousand years and is witness to the
significance of Stirling.</p>

<p>Here, in 843, was fought the battle of Cambuskenneth,
and the Painted People fell back,
and Kenneth, who did not paint, made himself
king of an increasing Scotland.</p>

<p>Here, in 1297, was fought the battle of Stirling
Bridge, and William Wallace with a thousand
men&mdash;but Scotsmen&mdash;defeated the Earl of
Surrey and the Abbot Cressingham with five
thousand Englishmen.</p>

<p>Here, in 1298, was fought the battle of Falkirk,
and Wallace was defeated. But not for
long. Dead, he continued to speak.</p>

<p>Here, in 1313, was fought the battle of Bannockburn,
forty thousand Scots against a hundred
thousand English, Irish and Gascons.
And The Bruce established Scotland Forever.</p>

<p>Here, in 1488, was fought the battle of Sauchieburn,
the nobles against James III, and
James flying from the field was treacherously
slain.</p>

<p>Here, in 1715, was fought the battle of Sheriffmuir,
when Mar and Albany with all their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
men marched up the hill of Muir and then
marched down again.</p>

<p>Here, in 1745, Prince Charles experienced
one of his great moments; how his great moments
stand forth in the pathos, yes, and the
bathos, of his swift career.</p>

<p>It is a tremendous panorama.</p>

<p class="poem">
"Scots, wha ha'e wi' Wallace bled!<br />
Scots, wham Bruce has aften led!"<br />
</p>

<p>I listened while the guide went through with
the battle, which, of course, is the Battle of
Bannockburn. How The Bruce disposed his
army to meet the English host he knew was coming
up from the south to relieve the castle garrison;
how they appeared at St. Ninians suddenly,
and the ever-seeing Bruce remarked to Moray,
who had been placed in charge of that defense&mdash;"there
falls a rose from your chaplet"&mdash;it
is almost too romantic not to be apocryphal;
and how Moray (who was the Randolph Moray
who scaled the crags at Edinburgh that March
night) countered the English dash for the castle
and won out; how in the evening of the day as
King Robert was inspecting his lines for the
battle of the to-morrow, a to-morrow which had
been scheduled the year before&mdash;"unless by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
St. John's day"; they had then a sense of leisure&mdash;the
English knight Sir Henry de Bohun
spurred upon him to single combat; it is worth
while listening to the broad Scots of the guide
as he repeats his well-conned, his well-worn, but
his immortal story&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"High in his stirrups stood the King<br />
And gave his battle-ax the swing,<br />
Right on de Boune, the whiles he passed,<br />
Fell that stern dint&mdash;the first, the last,<br />
Such strength upon the blow was put,<br />
The helmet crashed like hazel nut."<br />
</p>

<p>And all the battle the next day, until King
Edward rides hot-trod to Berwick, leaving half
his host dead upon this pleasant green field
that lies so unremembering to the south of the
castle. There is no more splendid moment in
human history, unless all battles seem to you
too barbaric to be splendid. But it made possible
a nation&mdash;and, I take it, Scotland has been
necessary to the world.</p>

<p>If this is too overwhelming a remembrance,
there is an opposite to this, looking across the
level lands of the Carse. The view leads past
the Bridge of Allan, on to Dunblane, near which
is the hill of Sheriffmuir. You can see the two
armies in the distance of time and of the plain,
creeping on each other unwittingly&mdash;and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
guide, too, is glad to turn to a later and less
revered moment&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"Some say that we wan,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Some say that they wan,</span><br />
And some say that nane wan at a', man;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But o' ae thing I'm sure,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That at Sheriffmuir</span><br />
A battle there was that I saw, man;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And we ran, and they ran,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And they ran, and we ran,</span><br />
And they ran and we ran awa', man."<br />
</p>

<p>To-day the wind has swept all these murmurs
of old wars into the infinite forgotten.
The world is as though MacAlpine and Wallace
and The Bruce and Prince Charles had not
been. Or, is it? It looks that way, at this
quiet moment, in this quiet century, and in this
country where there is such quiet; a country
with such a long tumult, a country with such
a strange silence. But the rest of the world
would never have been as it is but for the events
that lie thick about here, but for the race which
was bred in such events.</p>

<p class="poem">
"And the castle stood up black<br />
With the red sun at its back."<br />
</p>

<p>There is something more dour about Stirling
than Edinburgh. It is, in the first place, too
useful. One never thinks of the castle at Edin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>burgh
as anything but romantic, of the troops
as anything but decorative. Stirling is still
used, much of it closed, and it has the bare, uninviting
look of a historic place maintained by
a modern up-keep.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 378px;">
<img src="images/i432.jpg" width="378" height="600" alt="Stirling Castle" title="" />
<span class="caption1">Stirling Castle</span>
</div>

<p>Evidently when Burns visited it he found a
ruin, and was moved to express his Jacobitism&mdash;would
a poet be anything but a Jacobite?&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"Here Stuarts once in glory reign'd,<br />
And laws for Scotland's weal ordain'd;<br />
But now unroof'd their palace stands,<br />
Their scepter's sway'd by other hands;<br />
The injured Stuart line is gone,<br />
A race outlandish fills their throne&mdash;"<br />
</p>

<p>Soon after you enter the gate you come upon
the dungeon of Roderick Dhu, and here you get
the beginnings of that long song of the Lake,
which lies to the west, when Allan Bane tunes
his harp for Roderick&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"Fling me the picture of the fight,<br />
When my clan met the Saxon's might,<br />
I'll listen, till my fancy hears<br />
The clang of swords, the crash of spears!"<br />
</p>

<p>You may look into the Douglass room, where
James II stabbed the Earl of Douglass (1452).
It is a dark room for a dark deed. And the
guide repeats Douglass's refusal to the king:</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span></p>

<p class="poem">
"No, by the cross it may not be!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I've pledged my kingly word.</span><br />
And like a thunder cloud he scowled,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And half unsheathed his sword.</span><br />
Then drew the king that jewel'd glaive<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which gore so oft had spilt,</span><br />
And in the haughty Douglass heart<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He sheathed it to the hilt."</span><br />
</p>

<p>The Douglasses, we see, still thought themselves
"peer to any lord in Scotland here,"
and the provocation to the Stewart, merely a
second Stewart, must have been great&mdash;"my
kingly word"! and a "half sheathed" sword!
Perhaps we shall have to forgive this second
James about whom we know little but this affair,
who seems as ineffective a monarch as
James the Second of two centuries later.</p>

<p>It is rather with Mary, and with her father
and her son, that we associate Stirling. James
V took his commoner title of "the Gudeman of
Ballengeich" from here, when he went abroad
on those errantries which all the Stewarts have
dearly loved. At Stirling it seems more possible
that James V did write those poems which,
yesterday in Edinburgh I felt like attributing
to James IV. North of the bridge there is a
hill, Moat Hill, called familiarly Hurley Haaky,
because the Fifth James enjoyed here the rare
sport of coasting down hill on a cow's skull.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
The Scot can derive coasting from "Hurley"
and skull from "Haaky"&mdash;a clever people!</p>

<p>Queen Mary was brought to Stirling when a
wee infant and crowned in the old High church,
September 9, 1543&mdash;and cried all the time they
were making her queen. Surely "it came with
ane lass and it will pass with ane lass." It
was from Stirling that she was taken to France,
and when she returned she included Stirling in
her royal progress. I cannot think she was
much here. Mary was not dour. Still, historic
rumour has her married here, secretly
to Darnley, and, in the rooms of Rizzio! And
she came here once to see her princely son, hurriedly,
almost stealthily, as if she felt impending
fate.</p>

<p>That son was much here. Stirling was considered
a safer place for James VI than Edinburgh,
and then, of course, it was such a covenanted
place. James was baptized here also,
and his Royal Mother was present, but not
Darnley. He refused to come, but sat carousing&mdash;as
usual&mdash;in Willie Bell's Lodging, still
standing in Broad Street, if you care to look on
it. Young James merely looked at the ceiling
of the High church, and pointing his innocent
finger at it, gravely criticized, "there is a hole."
James was crowned in the High church, Mary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
being at Loch Leven, and the coronation sermon
was preached by Knox, who "enjoyed the
proudest triumph of his life." Then, I know,
baby James had to sit through a two or three
hour sermon. For once I am sorry for him.</p>

<p>From the courtyard one sees the iron bars
in the palace windows placed there to keep
James from falling out&mdash;and others from stealing
in? And here in the royal apartments,
King James was taught his Latin and Greek
like any other Scots boy, and by that same
George Buchanan who was his mother's instructor&mdash;and
her defamer. Perhaps he was the author
of the betraying Casket letter; in spite of
Froude's criticism based on internal evidence,
that only Shakespeare or Mary could have written
it. I can almost forgive Buchanan, for at
one time when James was making more noise
than beseemed a pupil of Buchanan, this schoolmaster
birched him then and there, whereupon
the royal tear fell, and the royal yowl was
lifted&mdash;and Lady Mar rushed in to quiet this
uproarious division in the kingdom.</p>

<p>The archives of Stirling were once rich in
Scottish records. But General Monk removed
them to London when he moved on that capital
with the king also in his keeping. Years and
years after, when Scotland demanded back her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
records, they were sent by sea, the ship foundered,
and sunk&mdash;and we have a right to accept
legend as history in this land of lost records.</p>

<p>One may use Stirling Castle for lovelier ends
than history or battle, for temporal ends of
beauty&mdash;which is not temporal. Else would
the prospect from these ramparts not linger immortally
in the memory and flash upon the inward
eye as one of the most wonderful views
in all the world.</p>

<p>From Queen Mary's Lookout there is the
King's Park, with the King's Knot, the mysterious
octagonal mound; it may have looked
lovelier when Mary looked down on its flower
gardens and its orchards, but this green world
is sightly.</p>

<p>From the battlements above the Douglass
garden there is a magnificent survey; the rich
Carse of broad alluvial land with the Links of
the Firth winding in and out among the fields,
shining, and steely, reluctant to widen out into
the sea. The Ochils from the far background,
and nearer is the Abbey Craig, thickly wooded
and crowned by the Wallace monument, which
while it adds nothing to the beauty of the scene,
would have made such a commanding watch
tower for Wallace. Just below is the old
Bridge which&mdash;not this bridge, but it looks old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
enough with its venerable five hundred years&mdash;divided
the English forces. Near by, on one
of the Links, stands the tower of Cambuskenneth
Abbey, a pleasant walk through fields
and a ferry ride across the Forth, to this memoried
place, which once was a great abbey
among abbeys; I doubt not David founded it.
Bruce once held a parliament in it. Now it is
tenanted chiefly by the mortal remains of that
Third James who took flight from Sauchieburn,
and whose ghost so haunted his nobles for years
after. Queen Margaret also lies here, she who
sat stitching, stitching, stitching, while those
same nobles raged through Linlithgow and
sought their king. Cambuskenneth&mdash;the name
is splendid&mdash;is but a remnant of grandeur.
But there are a few charming cottages nearby,
rose-embowered, perhaps with roses that descend
from those in Mary's garden.</p>

<p>Across to the north is the Bridge of Allan,
come to be a celebrated watering place&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"On the banks of Allan Water<br />
None so fair as she."<br />
</p>

<p>Far across to the north is Dunblane, with a
restored-ruined cathedral&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"The sun has gone down o'er the lofty Ben Lomond<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">And left the red clouds to preside o'er the scene,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To muse on sweet Jessie the flower o' Dunblane."</span><br />

<span class="caption">DOUNE CASTLE.</span>
</div>

<p>In the green nestle of the woods, away to the
right, are the battlements of Doune&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"Oh, lang will his lady<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Look frae the Castle Doune,</span><br />
Ere she see the Earl o' Moray<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Come sounding through the toun."</span><br />
</p>

<p>The Bonnie Earl was murdered at Donibristle
Castle, on Inverkeithing Bay across the
Forth from Edinburgh, where the King sent
his lordship&mdash;"oh, woe betide ye, Huntly"&mdash;to
do the deed. It was our same kingly James
VI, and I like to think that his life had its entertaining
moments, even if Anne of Denmark
did have to look long and longingly down from
the battlements of Doune.</p>

<p>The lookout to the north is called the Victoria&mdash;as
if to link Victoria with Mary! But
the old queen was proudest of her blood from
the eternally young queen. An inscription on
the wall registers the fact that Queen Victoria
and the Prince Consort visited the castle in
1842.</p>

<p>And not any sovereign since until 1914.</p>

<p>I had reached the city in the mid-afternoon,
unconscious of royalty, that is, of living royalty,
as one is in Scotland. It seems that the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
king and queen, George and Mary, were making
a visit to Stirling. Consequently there
were no carriages at the station&mdash;and one must
be very careful how one walked on the royal
crimson carpet. Two small boys who scorned
royalty, were impressed into service, to carry
bags to the hotel. But the press of the people
was too great. The king and queen had issued
from the castle, were coming back through the
town</p>

<p class="poem">
"The castle gates were open flung,<br />
The quivering drawbridge rock'd and rung,<br />
And echo'd loud the flinty street<br />
Beneath the coursers' clattering feet,<br />
As slowly down the steep descent<br />
Fair Scotland's King and nobles went."<br />
</p>

<p class="noidt">I took refuge in a bank building, and even secured
a place at the windows. For some reason
the thrifty people had not rented these
advantageous casements. The king and queen
passed. I saw them plainly&mdash;yes, plainly.
And the people were curiously quiet. They did
not mutter, they were decorous, there was no
repudiation, but&mdash;what's a king or queen of
diluted Stewart blood to Scotsmen of this undiluted
town?</p>

<p>That afternoon in the castle I understood.
An elderly Scotsman&mdash;I know of no people<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
whom age so becomes, who wear it with such
grace and dignity and retained power&mdash;looking
with me at the memorial tablet to Queen Victoria
and Prince Albert, in the west lookout,
explained&mdash;"It's seventy years since royalty
has been here. Not from that day to this."</p>

<p>It seems that on the old day, the day of 1842,
when royalty rode in procession through the
streets of Stirling, the commoners pressed too
close about. It offended the queen; she liked
a little space. (I remembered the old pun perpetrated
by Lord Palmerston, when he was
with Queen Victoria at the reviewing of the
troops returned from the Crimea, and at the
queen's complaining that she smelled spirits,
"Pam" explained&mdash;"Yes, esprit de corps.")
So she returned not at all to Stirling. I could
wish King Edward had, the one Hanoverian
who has succeeded in being a Stewart.</p>

<p>The view is almost as commanding from
Ladies Rock in the old cemetery, whither I went,
because in the very old days I had known intimately,
as a child reader, the "Maiden Martyr,"
and here was to find her monument.</p>

<p>There are other monuments, none so historic,
so grandiose, so solemn. The friends of a gentleman
who had died about mid-century record
that he died "at Plean Junction." Somehow it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
seemed very uncertain, ambiguous, capable of
mistake, to die at a Junction out of which must
run different ways.</p>

<p>And one man, buried here, was brought all
the way, as the tombstone publishes, from "St.
Peter, Minnesota." It's a historic town, to its
own people. But what a curious linking with
this very old town. I thought of a man who
had hurried away from Montana the winter before,
because he wanted to "smell the heather
once more before I die." And he had died in
St. Paul, Minnesota, only a thousand miles on
his way back to the heather.</p>

<p>Viewed from below, the castle is splendid.
The road crosses the bridge, skirts the north
side of the Rock, toward the King's Knot; a
view-full walk, almost as good, almost, as Edinburgh
from Princes Gardens; this green and
pastoral, that multicoloured and urban. The
whole situation is very similar, the long ridge
of the town, the heaven-topping castle hill.
Stirling is the Old Town of Edinburgh minus
the New Town. And so we confess ourselves
modern. Stirling is not so lovely; yet it is
more truly, more purely Scottish. Edinburgh
is a city of the world. Stirling is a town of
Scotland.</p>

<small>THE WEST COUNTRY</small></h2>

<h4><i>Glasgow</i></h4>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 68px;">
<img src="images/letter-i.jpg" width="68" height="75" alt="I" title="I" />
</div>
<p class="dropcap"> cannot think why, in a book to be called
deliberately "The Spell of Scotland,"
there should be a chapter on Glasgow.</p>

<p>I remember that in his "Picturesque Notes,"
to the second edition Robert Louis Stevenson
added a foot-note in rebuke to the Glaswegians
who had taken to themselves much pleasure at
the reservations of Stevenson's praise of Edinburgh&mdash;"But
remember I have not yet written
a book on Glasgow." He never did. And did
any one ever write "Picturesque Notes on Glasgow"?</p>

<p>I remember that thirty years ago when a college
professor was making the "grand tour"&mdash;thirty
years ago seems as far back as three
hundred years when James Howell was making
his "grand tour"&mdash;he asked a casually met Glaswegian
what there was to be seen, and this honest
Scot, pointing to the cathedral declared,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
"that's the only aydifyce ye'll care to look at."</p>

<p>I should like to be singular, to write of picturesque
points in Glasgow. But how can it be
done? Glasgow does not aspire to picturesqueness
or to historicalness. Glasgow is content,
more than content, in having her commerce and
her industry always "in spate."</p>

<p>Glasgow is the second city of size in the
United Kingdom, and the first city in being itself.
London is too varied and divided in interests;
it never forgets that it is the capital of the
world, and a royal capital. Glasgow never forgets
that it is itself, very honestly and very
democratically, a city of Scots. Not of royal
Stewarts, and no castle dominates it. But a
city made out of the most inveterate Scottish
characteristics. Or I think I would better say
Scotch. That is a practical adjective, and
somewhat despised of culture; therefore applicable
to Glasgow. While Scottish is romantic
and somewhat pretending.</p>

<p>Glasgow is the capital of the Whig country,
of the democratic Scotland of covenanting ancestry.
Glasgow is precisely what one would
expect to issue out of the energy and honesty
and canniness and uncompromise of that
corner of the world. Historically it belongs
to Wallace, the commoner-liberator. And if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
Burns is the genius of this southwestern Scotland,
as Scott is of the southeastern, it is precisely
the difference between the regions; as
Edinburgh and Glasgow differ.</p>

<p>The towns are less than an hour apart by
express train. They are all of Scotch history
and characteristics apart in quality and in
genius. Edinburgh is still royal, and sits supreme
upon its hill, its past so present one forgets
it is the past. Glasgow never could have
been royal; and so it never was significant until
royal Scotland ceased to be, and democratic
Scotland, where a man's a man for a' that,
came to take the place of the old, to take it completely,
utterly. So long as the world was old,
was the Old World, and looked toward the East,
Edinburgh would be the chief city. When the
world began to be new, and to look toward the
New World, Glasgow came swiftly into being,
and the race is to the swift.</p>

<p>There is history to Glasgow, when it was a
green pleasant village, and there was romance.
It is but a short way, a foot-path journey if
the pleasant green fields still invited, out to
Bothwell Castle; splendid ruin, and, therefore,
recalling Mary and Darnley and the Lennoxes,
but not Bothwell. But Landside, where Mary
was defeated, is a Glaswegian suburb, Kelvingrove&mdash;"let
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
us haste"&mdash;is a prosperous residence
district. The Broomielaw, lovely word,
means simply and largely the harbour of Glasgow,
made deliberately out of Clyde water in
order that Glasgow's prosperity might flow out
of the very heart of the city. "Lord, let Glasgow
flourish according to the preaching of Thy
word," ran the old motto. It has been shortened
of late.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 512px;">
<img src="images/i448.jpg" width="512" height="600" alt="PORTRAIT OF THOMAS CARLYLE, BY WHISTLER." title="" />
<span class="caption">PORTRAIT OF THOMAS CARLYLE, BY WHISTLER.</span>
</div>

<p>The heart of the city is dreary miles of long
monotonous streets, where beauty is never
wasted in grass blade or architecture. George's
Square may be noble, it has some good monuments,
but it is veiled in commercial grime, like
all the town. What could be expected of a city
that would name its principal business street,
"Sauchieburn," memorializing and defying
that petty tragedy?</p>

<p>There is an art gallery with Whistler's "Carlyle,"
and a few other notable pictures (John
Lavery's I looked at with joy) to redeem miles
of mediocrity. (Here I should like to be original
and not condemn, but there are the miles.)</p>

<p>There is a cathedral, that "aydifyce" of note,
touched almost nothing by the spirit of "reform";
for the burghers of Glasgow, then as
now, believing that their cathedral belonged to
them, rose in their might and cast out the de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>spoilers
before they had done more than smash
a few "idols." Therefore this shrine of St.
Kentigern's is more pleasing than the reformed
and restored shrine of St. Giles. The crypt
is particularly impressive. And the very pillar
behind which Rob Roy hid is all but labeled.
Of course it is "authentic," for Scott chose it.
What unrivaled literary sport had Scott in fitting
history to geography!</p>

<p>There is a University, one of the first in the
Kingdom; the city universities are gaining on
the classic Oxford and St. Andrews.</p>

<p>But chiefly there are miles of houses of working
men, more humble than they ought to be.
If Glasgow is one of the best governed cities in
the world, and has the best water supply in the
world&mdash;except that of St. Paul&mdash;would that the
Corporation of the City of Glasgow would scatter
a little loveliness before the eyes of these
patient and devoted workingmen.</p>

<p>But what a chorus their work raises. In
shipyards what mighty work is wrought, even
such tragically destined work, and manufactured
beauty, as the <i>Lusitania</i>!</p>

<p>From Glasgow it is that the Scot has gone
out to all the ends of the earth. If the "Darien
scheme" of wresting commerce from England
failed utterly, and Glasgow failed most of all,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
that undoing was the making of the town. It
is not possible to down the Scot. The smallest
drop of blood tells, and it never fails to be
Scottish. Most romantic, most poetic, most
reckless, most canny of people. The Highlander
and the Lowlander that Mr. Morley
found mixed in the character of Gladstone, and
the explanation of his character, is the explanation
of any Scot, and of Scotland.</p>


<h4><i>Ayr</i></h4>

<p>Always the West is the democratic corner of
a country; or, let me say almost always, if you
have data wherewith to dispute a wholesale assertion.
Sparta was west of Athens, La Rochelle
was west of Paris, Switzerland was west
of Gesler; Norway is west of Sweden, the
American West is west of the American East.
And Galloway and Ayrshire are the west Lowlands
of Scotland.</p>

<p>The West is newer always, freer, more open,
more space and more lure for independence.
The West is never feudal, until the West moves
on and the East takes its place. Here men develop,
not into lords and chiefs, but into men.
Wallace may come out of the West, but it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
after he has come out that he leads men, in the
establishment of a kingdom, but more in a wider
fight for freedom; while he is in the West he
adventures as a man among men, on the Waters
of Irvine, in Laglyne Wood, at Cumnock. And
a Bruce, struggling with himself, and setting
himself against a Comyn, may stagger out of a
Greyfriars at Dumfries, and, bewildered, exclaim,
"I doubt I have slain the Comyn!"
When a follower makes "siccar," and all the
religious and human affronts mass to sober
The Bruce, a king may come out of Galloway,
out of a brawl, if a church brawl, and establish
the kingdom and the royal line forever.</p>

<p>If a Wallace, if a Bruce, can proceed out of
these Lowlands&mdash;and a Paul Jones!&mdash;a poet
must come also. And a poet who is as much
the essence of that west country as chieftain
or king. Everything was ready to produce
Burns in 1759. William Burns had come from
Dunnottar, a silent, hard-working, God-fearing
Covenanter, into this covenanting corner of
Scotland. It was filled with men and women
who had grown accustomed to worshiping God
according to their independent consciences, and
in the shelter of these dales and hills, sometimes
harried by that covenanter-hunting fox,
Claverhouse&mdash;to his defeat; finally winning the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
right to unconcealed worship. Seven years
gone, and William Burns having built the
"auld clay biggan" at Alloway, he married a
Carrick maid, Agnes Broun, a maid who had
much of the Celt in her. And Robert Burns
was born.</p>

<p>It is of course only after the event that we
know how fortunate were the leading circumstances,
how inevitable the advent of Robert
Burns. Father and mother, time and place,
conspired to him. And all Scotland, all that
has been Scotland since, results from him. It
is Scott who reconstructed Scotland, made the
historic past live. But it is Burns who is Scotland,
Scotland remains of his temper; homely,
human, intense, impassioned; with a dash and
more of the practical and frugal necessary for
the making of a nation, but worse than superfluous
for the making of a Burns.</p>

<p>Three towns of this Scottish corner contend
not for the birth but for the honours of Burns.
If Dumfries is the capital of Burnsland and the
place of his burial, Ayr is gateway to the land
and the place of his birth; while Kilmarnock,
weaver's town and most unpoetic, but productive
of poets and poetesses, claims for itself the
high and distinct literary honours, having published
the first edition in an attic, and having<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
loaned its name as title for the most imposing
edition, and having in its museum possession
all the published Burns editions.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i458.jpg" width="600" height="420" alt="Ayr River" title="" />
<span class="caption1">Ayr River</span>
</div>

<p>To follow his footsteps through Burnsland
were impossible to the most ardent. For Burns
was a plowman who trod many fields, and
turned up many daisies, and disturbed many a
wee mousie, a poet who dreamed beside many a
stream, and if he spent but a brief lifetime in
all, it would take a lifetime, and that active, to
overtake him.</p>

<p>"I have no dearer aim than to make leisurely
pilgrimages through Caledonia; to sit on the
fields of her battles, to wander on the romantic
banks of her rivers, and to muse on the stately
towers or venerable ruins, once the honoured
abodes of her heroes."</p>

<p>He did this abundantly. We have followed
him in many a place. But in Burnsland it were
all too intimate, if not impossible. He knew
all the rivers of this west country, Nith, Doon,
Ayr, Afton.</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"The streams he wandered near;</span><br />
The maids whom he loved, the songs he sung,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All, all are dear."</span><br />
</p>

<p>He did not apparently know the sea, or love
it, although he was born almost within sound
of it; and he sings of it not at all. He knew
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
the legends of the land. "The story of Wallace
poured a Scottish prejudice into my
veins," and he deliberately followed the Bruce
legend, hoping it would enter into his blood and
spirit, and something large and worthy would
result. It did, not an epic, but the strong song
of a nation, "Scots wha hae."</p>

<p>His land was the home of Lollards and Covenanters.
Independence was in the blood. It
was the land of the "fighting Kennedys," who
disputed with each other, what time they were
not furnishing an Abbot of Crossraguel to dispute
with John Knox, or a Gude Maister Walter
Kennedy to have a "flytting" with the
Kynge's Makar, William Dunbar. Where
Burns secured his Jacobitism I do not know,
but, of course, a poet is by nature a Jacobite;
as he himself said, "the Muses were all Jacobite."</p>

<p>Burnsland is rich in other literary associations.
Johannes Scotus is reckoned to have
been born also at Ayr; and there are John
Galt, James Boswell, James Montgomery, Alexander
Smith, Ainslie, Cunningham, and the
Carlyles, and Scott in some of his most lively
romances. The Book of Taliessin is written
in part of this land, the Admirable Crichton
was born here. It is a close-packed little port<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>-manteau
of land. There is pursuit enough for
at least a summer's travel. And, without
doubt, there are as many pilgrims who explore
Ayrshire as Warwickshire, and much more lovingly.</p>

<p>The entrance is by Ayr. And this I think
can be made most claimingly, most fitly, by
steamer from Belfast. For one thing, it avoids
entrance at Glasgow. Ayr is still a sea port of
some importance; and Ireland, democratic, romantic,
intimate, is a preparation for this similar
country of Galloway and about; both lands
are still Celtic.</p>

<p>Ayr looks well from the sea as one comes
in, although in the day of Burns the Ratton-key
was a more casual place, and harbour works
to retain the traffic were not yet built. But the
town sits down well into the waterside of its
Doon and Ayr rivers, much like a continental
town where fresh waters are precious. There
is long suburban dwelling, not as it was a hundred
and fifty years ago.</p>

<p>And Ayr looks out on the sea with a magnificent
prospect from any of her neighbouring
segments of coast, with ruined castles set properly,
with the dark mass of romantic Arran
purple across the waters, with Ailsa Rock evi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>dent,
and to a far-seeing eye the blue line of
Ireland whence we have come.</p>

<p>There is small reason for staying in Ayr, unless
for a wee bit nappie in Tam o' Shanter's
inn, which still boasts itself the original and
only Tam and hangs a painting above the door
to prove itself the starting point, this last "ca'
hoose," for Alloway.</p>

<p>To Alloway one may go by tram! It sounds
flat and unprofitable. But the gray mare Meg
is gone, has followed her tail into the witches
night. And if it were not the tram it would
be a taxi. And what have witches and warlocks
to do with electricity, in truth how can they
compete with electricity?</p>

<p class="poem">
"Nae man can tether time or tide;<br />
The hour approaches Tam maun ride;<br />
That hour, o' night's black arch the keystane,<br />
That dreary hour he mounts his beast in;<br />
An' sic a night he taks the road in<br />
As ne'er poor sinner was abroad in."<br />
</p>

<p>To follow, in a tram, in broad daylight, oh,
certainly the world has changed, and the Deil
too since "the Deil had business on his hand."
The occupations that are gone! It is a highway
one follows to-day, suburban villas and
well-kept fields line the way; no need to "skel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>pit
on thro' dub and mire." Tam would be
quite without adventure. And to-day one wonders
if even the lightning can play about this
commonplace way. There is however the Race-course&mdash;some
reminder of Meg!</p>

<p>Yet, it is possible to forget this pleasant day,
and to slip back into old night as</p>

<p class="poem">
"Before him Doon pours a' his floods;<br />
The doubling storm roars through the woods;<br />
The lightnings flash frae pole to pole;<br />
Near and more near the thunders roll;<br />
When, glimmering through the groaning trees,<br />
Kirk Alloway seem'd in a bleeze."<br />
</p>

<p>The walls of the Auld Kirk lie before us&mdash;and
"Auld Nick in shape o' beast" is sitting
under "the winnock bunker i' the east." Who
would deny that he also like Tammie "glower'd
amazed and curious"?</p>

<p class="poem">
"The piper loud and louder blew,<br />
The dancers quick, and quicker flew;<br />
They reel'd, they set, they cross'd, they cleekit,<br />
Till ilka carlin swat and reekit,<br />
And coost her duddies to the wark,<br />
And linket at it in her sark."<br />
</p>

<p>The ride on this tram has developed a dizziness.</p>

<p class="poem">
"Wi' tippenny we fear nae evil;<br />
Wi' usquebae we'll face the devil!"<br />
</p>

<p>Did we cry "weel done, cutty sark!" Then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
we, too, must descend and hurry on foot to the
old Brig o' Doon. Not pausing long for The
Monument, even to look at the wedding ring
of Jean Armour, or the Bible Burns gave to
Highland Mary; but on to the Auld Kirk which
stands opposite.</p>

<p>To Burns we owe this church in more ways
than one. When a certain book of "Antiquities"
was being planned, Burns asked that the
Auld Kirk of Alloway be included. If Burns
would make it immortal? yes. So the story of
Tam o' Shanter came to make Kirk Alloway
forever to be remembered. What would William
Burns, covenanter, have thought? For I
cannot but think that William looked often
askance at the acts of his genius-son. But
William was safely buried within the kirk, and
if the epitaph written by the son reads true,
William was excellently covenanted.</p>

<p class="poem">
"O ye whose cheek the tear of pity stains,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Draw near with pious rev'rence and attend.</span><br />
Here lies the loving husband's dear remains,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The tender father, and the gen'rous friend.</span><br />
The pitying heart that felt for human woe,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The dauntless heart that fear'd no human pride,</span><br />
The friend of man, to vice alone a foe,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For 'ev'n his failings lean'd to virtue's side.'"</span><br />
</p>

<p>The auld clay biggan still stands in Alloway,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
and "the banks and braes o' bonnie Doon"
bloom as "fresh and fair" to-day as they did
a century and a half ago. It is a simpler place
than the birth house on High Street in Stratford,
and a simpler environment than College
Wynd in Edinburgh. This is a true cotter's
home, and Saturday nights within must have
been of the description.</p>

<p>Somehow it is less of a tourist's way of
forced entry, this through the barn, than the
basement door at Abbotsford; and so one passes
through the byre and into the kitchen, where
stands the bed in which Robert Burns was born.
It is all beautifully homely, as lowly as a manger;
and, how the world has been filled by what
was once small frail life herein!</p>

<p>It is difficult to divide the poet's relics among
so many claimant places, but here and in the
museum are many mementoes of the poet. For
this as well as Kirk Alloway is a national monument,
or something like.</p>

<p>There was a century during which this was
merely a clay biggan, and a public house, and
that offended no one, least of all the friends of
the poet. Except Keats. He came hither in
1818. The host was drunk most of the time,
and garrulous. Keats complained that it affected
his "sublimity." And, for once, Keats
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
turned severe self-critic. "The flat dog made
me write a flat sonnet."</p>

<p>It was while living at Mount Oliphant, two
miles east of Ayr, when Burns was fifteen, that
he began that long, long list of lasses whom he
loved and whom he made immortal with a verse.
He might have said with James V,&mdash;and much
he resembled that Gudeman o' Ballangeich&mdash;"it
came wi' ane lass and it will gae wi' ane lass."
The first was Nelly Kilpatrick, daughter of the
miller of Perclewan&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"O, ance I lov'd a bonnie lass,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ay, and I love her still."</span><br />
</p>

<p>The last was Jessie Lewars, who ministered
to him in those last days in the Millhole brae in
Dumfries&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"O wert thou in the cauld blast<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On yonder lea, on yonder lea,</span><br />
My plaidie to the angry airt,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I'd shelter thee, I'd shelter thee."</span><br />
</p>

<p>To Kilmarnock one goes for its name. But
"the streets and neuks o' Killie" are changed
since that Burns' day. It is a sprawling, thriving
factory town, a town of weavers&mdash;and a
town of poets. There is something in the whirr
of wheels, to those who are within it, which establishes
rhythm in the ear, and often leads<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
to well-measured poetry! Surely a weaver is
equal to a plowman, and I fancy that many a
workingman and working lass with lines running
through the head walk this Waterloo
street, pass Tam o' Shanter's arms, and looks
above the Loan Office at the attic where that
precious first edition was printed in 1786.
Poems and pawn broking&mdash;Waterloo Street is
a suggestive Grub street.</p>

<p>From Kilmarnock to Dumfries by train is a
Burns pilgrimage, even though it be taken without
break, and in seventy-seven minutes! And
interspersed are other memories. It is entirely
what Burnsland should be, nothing set down in
high tragedy, but all lyrical, with gentle hills,
whispering rivers, and meadows and woodlands
all the way.</p>

<p>Mauchline, where the burst of song was like
that of a skylark, the very outpouring of the
man's soul; here lies the field where he turned
up the daisy and found an immortal lyric.</p>

<p>Auchinleek, where Boswell and Dr. Johnson
paused on their journey and where to the hot-flung
query of the Doctor, "Pray, what good
did Cromwell ever do the country?" the judicial
and wrathful father of our Boswell flung the
hotter retort&mdash;"He gart kings ken they had a
lith in their necks." The Scottish tongue is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
the tongue of rebellions. Should we stay in this
corner of the world longer we might turn covenanting
and Cromwellian!</p>

<p>Cumnock, which William Wallace made his
headquarters between the battle of Stirling
bridge and that of Falkirk.</p>

<p>New Cumnock, whence the Afton so sweetly
falls into the Nith&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"Flow gently, sweet Afton, amang thy green braes,<br />
Flow gently, I'll sing thee a song in thy praise."<br />
</p>

<p>Kirkconnel, which is said not to be the Kirkconnel
where Fair Helen lies&mdash;but like the
blasted heath, will it not serve?</p>

<p class="poem">
"I wish I were where Helen lies,<br />
Baith night and day on me she cries."<br />
</p>

<p class="noidt">And in any event "The Bairnies cuddle doon
at Nicht" were "waukrife rogues" in Kirkconnel.</p>

<p>Sanquhar to Thornhill, with rounding green
hills along the Nith, with memories of Old
Queensberry and Defoe and Wordsworth and
Coleridge and Allan Ramsay and Dr. John
Brown, and Carlyle. Thornhill is Dalgarnock,
where fairs were held&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"But a' the niest week, as I petted wi' care,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I gaed to the tryste o' Dalgarnock,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>And wha but my fine, fickle lover was there?<br />
I glowr'd as I'd seen a warlock, a warlock,<br />
I glowr'd as I'd seen a warlock."<br />
</p>

<p>Dunscore lies to the right with "Redgauntlet"
memories, and a few miles farther on is
Craigenputtock.</p>

<p>Ellisland a brief moment, where immortal
"Tam" was written as under the spell of a warlock.</p>


<h4><i>Dumfries</i></h4>

<p>It is a proud little city, more than a bit self-satisfied.
It realizes that its possession of the
mortal remains of Burns gives it large claim
in his immortality, and the Burns monument
is quite the center of the town.</p>

<p>Yet Dumfries is well satisfied from other argument.
Historically, it goes back to Bruce
and Comyn, and even to a Roman beyond. But
there is nothing left of old Greyfriars where
the killing of Comyn took place. Dumfries had
its moment in the Forty Five, for the Bonnie
Prince was here as he went down to the invasion
of England, and his room in what is now
the Commercial Hotel may be looked into but
not lodged in; Dumfries, in spite of Covenant,
has its modicum of Jacobitism.</p>

<p>It is in "Humphrey Clinker" that Smollett
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
compels some one to say "If I was confined to
Scotland I would choose Dumfries as my place
of residence." Confined to Scotland, forsooth!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i472.jpg" width="600" height="355" alt="CAERLAVEROCK CASTLE." title="" />
<span class="caption">CAERLAVEROCK CASTLE.</span>
</div>

<p>Dumfries is larger than it was in the days of
Burns, and very busy withal, in factories and
railroads. But it is still a country town, still
hints at something of dales and woods and
streams, even on High Street. The land about
is true Burnsland; low, gentle hills closing in
the horizon in a golden sea of warmth and sunlight,
and the Nith a pleasant stream. It makes
a great bend about Dumfries, with Maxwelltown
across the water, and still</p>

<p class="poem">
"Maxwellton's braes are bonny<br />
Where early fa's the dew."<br />
</p>

<p>Farther a-field there lies Sweetheart Abbey,
built by the Lady Devorgilla, widow of John
Balliol, and founder of Balliol at Oxford; one
of the most beautiful ruins not only in Scotland
but in the Kingdom. Caerlaverock castle,
the Ellangowan of "Guy Mannering," stands
on the Solway, which still, like love, ebbs and
flows. Ecclefechan lies east. "O, wat ye wha's
in yon toun," Burns sang from here, but later
it was made a place of pilgrimage, with its immortal
dust come back from London for Scottish
rest.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span></p>

<p>And in St. Michael's Burns was laid to rest
in 1796, and twenty years later was placed in
this mausoleum in the corner of the churchyard.
A sumptuous monument for so simple a
man.</p>

<p class="poem">
"He came when poets had forgot<br />
How rich and strange the human lot;<br />
How warm the tints of Life; how hot<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are Love and Hate;</span><br />
And what makes Truth divine, and what<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Makes Manhood great.</span><br />
<br />
"A dreamer of the common dreams,<br />
A fisher in familiar streams,<br />
He chased the transitory gleams<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That all pursue;</span><br />
But on his lips the eternal themes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Again were new."</span><br />
</p>

<p>The road leads southward, the Via Dolorosa
Mary took after Langside, the Via Victoriosa
which Prince Charles took&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"Wi' a hundred pipers an' a', an' a',<br />
Wi' a hundred pipers an' a', an' a',<br />
We'll up and gie them a blaw, a blaw,<br />
Wi' a hundred pipers an' a', an' a'.<br />
Oh, it's ower the Border awa', awa',<br />
It's ower the Border awa', awa',<br />
We'll on an' we'll march tae Carlisle Ha'<br />
Wi' its yetts and castles an' a', an' a'.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wi' a hundred pipers an' a', an' a'."</span>
